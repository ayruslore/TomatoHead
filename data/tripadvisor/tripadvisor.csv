We visited Feast for a business meeting with a party of 12. We were comfortably seated. There was a Singapore food festival happening there. Yet we had a wide variety of food options from Indian to Italian to Continental and an elaborate dessert spread. Highly recommend for business meetings.

“Excellent Brunch Buffet ”

The place offers excellent food and very wide variety for the Sunday Brunch. The only thing that needs improvement is the Sushi Bar, which was not upto the mark. It is a tad expensive at over RS 3000 per head (non alcoholic) (including taxes).

The music is so bloody loud in here! You can't have a normal conversation. The staff are pretty good though. The food is average. The drinks are creative but fine. They have a workspace on the second floor I think. It would be a lot more enjoyable if the music wasn't so jarring.

One of my favourite places when it comes to fine dining.
Being a vegetarian, finding good restaurants where there are good veg options is a difficult thing to do here in Bangalore. For me Toscano with their excellent thin crust pizzas, good pastas and the delicious Chocolate Kahlua Mousse makes this one of the better options in Bangalore.

Reviewed March 14, 2017



via mobile




Had a great meal at Chianti
Bangalore needed an alternative to Toscano whose menu has been boring for the past few years
Hope competition will drive the two restaurants to be innovative and really take care of the simple flavours that are the basis of Italian cooking

“Afternoon Drink and Lunch !”



Reviewed 1 week ago



via mobile




One of my all time favourites, more so because of the music ! Afternoon time is better at this place since the place is less crowded and you can have a conversation while having your drink and eats ! We tried out the Hurricane cocktail which is awesome, slightly on the sweeter fruity flavoured and lives up to its name....

“Andhra Cuisine delight”



Reviewed March 28, 2017




The vegetarian thali is amazing.Other's trying non veg here were bowled over too.Usually Andhra cuisine is spicy ,so request your spice level while ordering.It's a nice place to eat after doing all the shopping at M.G road.

Even on a Thursday evening it was hopping. Music was good; the German sausages were excellent and well priced with generous portions. Fries were crisp and went well with the Weiss beer on tap. You could smoke outside and place was large enough that smoke was not bothersome to non smokers.

The most beautiful bar in bangalore for sure!! beautifully done up interiors which is unique and also plush!

“Heard a lot about Nagarjun but its a disappointment”



Reviewed March 30, 2017




Many recommended Nagarjuna Restaurant for Andhra Thali but its a disappointment. Its just the hype people created. Food is average and service below average. Its the advantage of location is what they are selling upon. Nagarjuna should realize that there is a lot of competition in the market now.

If you are a morning walker or a jogger, this would be a perfect place for you as it is open as early as 7.30-8.00am.
And also for evening snacks as well
Self service

“Convenenient location and tasty veg food in Bangalore”



Reviewed March 29, 2017




Situated just off Residency road, this well known and reputed eatery serves amazing veg food . My personal favorite remains the veg thali ( unlimited) which will really fill your stomach!! Lunch time is usually very crowded and a bit of waiting time should be factored. The evening snacks are also very tasty.

Dosa is the only thing that comes to my mind while thinking of Vidyarthi Bhavan. The place is usually overcrowded and it's a long wait to get to the tables. The service is quick and as usual, the food is yum! RO purified water is provided. Crowd management can be a little better.

It's probably because that we had high expectations that this visit turned out to be disappointing. Service lacked warmth. Almost everything we ordered tasted the same. - Salt and pepper fry, Ben Thanh chicken, Red River riot fish, Jungle fish curry. Smoky noodles was the saving grace. We hope it would be better the next time around.

“Great Beer, Great Food”



Reviewed February 20, 2017




Fantastic spot, both for locals and tourists looking for a more western menu. Food was always cooked perfectly, and the in house brewed beer was served perfectly. They really take pride in the product they put on your table. Must visit if in Bangalore

The food and ambience at Sodabottleopenerwala continues to amaze me, although due to the absence of a reservation system, the wait times can get crazy. Luckily, it is located in the CBD and has many other places that you could go to if your wait time is long.

Visited this place with family youngsters. You can expect waiting to get a place but we were lucky to have got a space maybe because we landed here late @10.30 pm. Ambience, food, service all score above par.
I would definitely recommend if someone looking to eat out late.

“Great local micro brewery with perfect setting”



Reviewed 3 weeks ago




Tried this local micro brewery - latest lounge fad. I am impressed with the beer quality and finger food. We also took a small brewery tour and the staff was very helpful explaining the beer making process. Quite neat and clean.
Try buffalo wings one of the best here even garlic bread was amazing.
They have happy hours for lunch...

It's probably because that we had high expectations that this visit turned out to be disappointing. Service lacked warmth. Almost everything we ordered tasted the same. - Salt and pepper fry, Ben Thanh chicken, Red River riot fish, Jungle fish curry. Smoky noodles was the saving grace. We hope it would be better the next time around.

Well, the restaurant is good but certainly not the best. We were there for lunch. We ordered Bruschetta and Pizza del Chianti for starters followed by some grilled Salmon and Risotto. The food was ok. So was the service.

“Great place for breakfast to start your day right!”



Reviewed 4 weeks ago




Excellent spread with a wide selection of breakfast items. And if that's not enough you can also special order your favorite directly from the kitchen. To top it all, Chef Dhiren Das keeps a vigilant eye and adds a personal touch as he wanders around in the dining area and engages you in friendly conversation - a nice touch!

“If you absolutely need to eat a steak in Bangalore”



Reviewed April 5, 2017



via mobile




The Bierce Club is a micro brewery with a lively dining room. Food presentation is simple but very nice. Menu quite varied between dishes that feature Indian styles and flavorings to more western fare such as beef tenderloin. Beer selection is also quite good and interesting. They also offer a pretty good wine list, with many options ""by the glass""....

An old favourite! Oberoi always has a certain distinct vibe to it...again the place needs a face-lift. Settled for a fish tikka (not on the menu). Service again is top notch and one could easily see the difference in comparison with the many other rated hotels..

“Sumptuous Vegetarian Buffet”



Reviewed January 11, 2017




Have been to this place twice with family and it is a great place for food indulgence. While the price is a bit on the higher side, the taste makes up for it. It is surprising or rather an eye opener that food can taste good even without onion and garlic.
On a hindsight, the desserts may not be liked...

Didn't really know what to expect when told we were going to a place called Fisherman's Wharf when the nearest beach is more than 350km away. Well it didn't disappoint. Great selection of food with seafood with styles from Indian to Thai. A place great option for groups.

It is a quaint little place. Reeks charms of the old Bangalore eatery. Crowds, shared tables etc. The staff is polite and nothing to find fault with.
I did not enjoy the overly buttery dosa, but the coffee was good. Ypu can try this place if you like the Bene Dosa, else perhaps just stick to coffee.

After a week of eating out for dinner, we came here last and it was the best. We've been here before, so our expectations were high. Even if, like me, you are vegetarian, you will still enjoy the food, which is freshly prepared and very tasty. The breads are especially good. Service excellent. We could not fault it.

We were bit late for lunch (about 2:45) and some of the items were not available as that section of the kitchen was closed.
I would not say that the interiors were very good, so I felt the price was on the higher side compared to other restaurants in the locality.

The striking factor for me once I stepped into this fast food joint was the cleanliness - that alone is worth a visit any day. But there's bonus too - delicious food, fast service, decent place to sit and eat. Reach-ability is a bit of issue for me, is all.

This restaurant can be found in a hotel. The menu was a bit confusing until it was explained to us.
The specialty is lobster with a rich tomato sauce. Expensive but worth it. The food was tasty and a lentil dish to die for. So much butter in it but tasted incredible. Chef came out to give me the recipe....

“Must visit for veggies!”



Reviewed March 3, 2017




Terrific place for pure veggie and 'sattvik' food as the name suggests. Nice ambiance, not too expensive, decent service, for me this is next best to classic MTR and superb Rajdhani. Will surely go again...

Reviewed February 14, 2017




This place is lovely. The decor is muted and pretty. Lots of greenery. Cool and summery.
The beef pho is in a massive portion but I found the broth to be lacking in complexity and richness. It was still really good though. The beef lettuce cups were delicious and the summer rolls were perfect.
Service was friendly and polite.

“An italian restaurant and antipasti bar”

Just loved their grilled salmon in vinegar dressing and salad. Also their pizzas and buffet service is truly value for money. Located in the posh area of 5th block Koramangala, it is easily accessible and they do have valet parking.

I had been there for the 25th anniversary of my friends parents. I surely had a ball of a time but what topped that, was the ambience around. It surely is a space for the best of your times.

“Mediocre, at best”



Reviewed March 6, 2017




The Only Place consistently proves its only relevance to be the new (and great) gelato shop in its compounds and the nostalgia for old Bangaloreans. The food, for a vegetarian, is extremely average and not memorable. The Only Place is definitely avoidable, unless you like cucumber in your penne arrabbiata.

Reviewed March 6, 2017




When you enter you would feel good. You take a seat and the feeling stays. Order a beer and a short eat and its still ok. But dare not order a cocktail or something interesting to eat and then you realize this place is only good in the looks.

I liked the Garden setting of this restaurant from the first time I visited Taj West End in 1987. Tonight was different. The times have changed. They were playing my fav Boney M albeit too loudly and the diner crowd was perhaps ecstatic about it forgetting the serene settings and all etiquette. It totally spoiled the mood - don't know...

Amazing place and amazing beer with different flavours. Most amazing range of beers and very very nice ambience. The best part is that you have carrom and foosball to play with friends. Good to spend an evening with friends. The place is always full on any given day. Have been there at least 5 times.

been there a few times, and each time Chianti has been delightful. Joseph, the manager, was most carefully attentive, and offered specific suggestions on items we might like.
we had the verdure pizza, Salmon, stuffed chicken, and another chicken breast, followed by the Tiramisu and chocolate mousse. Each dish was very well made and delectable.
nicely done, will return again...

I'm a regular visitor to Barbeque Nation. Across outlets in Bangalore. The vegetarian starters are very good especially the ones with Pineapple. The food is ok, but the strategy is to eat maximum starters of various types barbecued on your table. They accept cards & service on tables in very quick.

“Nice evening out with colleagues ”



Reviewed January 11, 2017

Very tasty and served in a nice atmosphere. Shrimps, fish, chicken, vegetables all tasting very good also for a Scandinavian like me. All on skewers grilled at the table.
The appetizers were so abundant and so tasty that there was not enough room for the buffet with the main course.
Friendly and observant staff.

I visited Big Brewsky for dinner recently. The first thing that struck me was the ambience of the place. It offers both indoor and outdoor seating with a pond in the middle, filled with colourful koi fish. The seating is quite a bit, but in spite of it, people often need to wait for a table, such is the rush....

Second time dining here whilst staying at the hotel.
Nice ambience for a romantic meal.
Large selection but I would recommend the set menu (we had non vegetarian but you can also have vegetarian)
Great service

New stop at the Biere Club, 3 years later. Not as good as last time. Of course beer is always good, but the place seems older, would need so works... and I ate chicken wings, really just average. So this is no more in line with the price which is high for India.

“Second best Masale Dose in Bangalore”



Reviewed 4 weeks ago



via mobile




Crispy Masale dose is the USP of this restaurant, followed by Rave Vade, though Dose somehow doesn't taste as great as it was in the 90s and early 2Kx years.
Tasty dose which is crispy with butter on the inner side with the Aloo Palya.
1. Can be too crowded
2. Parking - Major Problem
Coffee is very good

Promoted as an American steakhouse, I came here for a steak. I saw lamb chops of the menu (my favorite) and changed my mind. A little sorry I did.

We had a visit on 20th Nov for breakfast, as usual this place is over crowded! But billing counter is well managed to move. The best about this place is value for money. Three among us had Idli, dosa and coffee... you will get shocked with the bill! In other places you will have to pay 3 times of this...

Stayed here for three nights and everything was lovely. I had both breakfast and lunch under the wide, cool verandah facing the gardens. A perfect spot to catch up on emails and read a book.

The food here is very good, especially the Masala Dosas. But the dosas have to be eaten hot and not cold. Invariably the dosas reach your table not cold, but not hot either. I would say the service needs to be improved.

“Good place to hangout and chill out”

I visited Big Brewsky for dinner recently. The first thing that struck me was the ambience of the place. It offers both indoor and outdoor seating with a pond in the middle, filled with colourful koi fish. The seating is quite a bit, but in spite of it, people often need to wait for a table, such is the rush....

I was told this was a great spot to try out some local beer. They were sold out of many options. It was a good place to visit for lunch, but there are so many better options in the city. It's certainly a trendy place, and doesn't cost too much. But I wouldn't visit again.

“Good place to come in a group”



Reviewed March 2, 2017



via mobile




Multiple floor pub in the UB city area. We had a big group event (~75 people), so they gave us the entire top floor. Decent service and prices. Food was average. But great evening with colleagues.

“Average fare”



Reviewed 2 weeks ago




Honestly, I didn't like this place much. Not that the service was bad or food was bland, but somehow the experience and ambience was not up to the mark for a reputed brand like theirs.
Too much crowd, long waiting time, and a hurried eating takes out the fizz from the actual eating experience.

Awesome Dim Sum and Chinese dishes to choose from. So good that we had two dinner events in one week. A must if you are craving Chinese food while in Bangalore. While you dine, be sure you enjoy the restaurant decor - absolutely beautiful.

After a week of eating out for dinner, we came here last and it was the best. We've been here before, so our expectations were high. Even if, like me, you are vegetarian, you will still enjoy the food, which is freshly prepared and very tasty. The breads are especially good. Service excellent. We could not fault it.

“Great Parsi food, although getting a table here is an issue.”



Reviewed 3 weeks ago




The food and ambience at Sodabottleopenerwala continues to amaze me, although due to the absence of a reservation system, the wait times can get crazy. Luckily, it is located in the CBD and has many other places that you could go to if your wait time is long.

“Terrible Experience”



Reviewed 3 weeks ago




We went as a group of 9 to Barbeque Nation at Lido Mall Bangalore. It was a pathetic experience. They forgot to serve us some of the starters. Many of the dishes on the buffet were empty even though the restaurant was also quite empty.
All in all a terrible experience.

Lovely idlis. My biggest grouse is that they never give sambar. The chutney may be fantastic but lack of sambar is a downer for me. If you're new to town and want to try out bangalorean vegetarian fare, this is one of the places to go to.

We were guided very well by Captain Anthony, whose hospitality along with that of Mr Vijay was outstanding. Highly recommend...

Reviewed March 20, 2017




Celebrated Birthday at Blue Ginger, food is just out of the world, the best Vietneme so far I had, dont remember the name of the dish but it was something close to soft crabs, that was just amazing. Will definitely visit Blue Ginger to taste the soft crab again. Awesome ambience and liked the service too.

In short its an eating joint with a bar. However, the interiors are cool, the menu unconventionally fusion and bar well stocked. More on the lines of a lounge bar. Has good music and service was above average. Its a chain so if its in a city you visitng guve it a visit.

“good food but lack ambience”



Reviewed October 24, 2016




went for dinner. great variety of food with superb and continuous service.THey believe in the maxim that they should feed their customers till they are really 'FED ' up
fixed menu so no hassles of picking and choosing. If you really want to do justice skip lunch.

The place is good in ambience and staff are really attentive. Food was a let down though, as it was cold when served and whatever asked was not available at the moment. Even few basic drinks were not available. Ended up paying a hefty bill which wasn't worth eating.

The Persian Terrace is an outdoor restaurant on the 4th floor of the Sheraton Grand serving middle eastern cuisine. The outdoor atmosphere close to the swimming pool makes for a great setting in the evenings. The kebabs, appetizers are delectable though portion sizes leave you a little wanting. So not the place to go to if you are ravenous !...

“Only italian”



Reviewed 1 week ago

This is a core italian resto atleast as per the menu. They dont serve any thing else. I found it a bit pricy especially the starters and pizza n pastas were as per standars. The quality is good and the food is also. They have a huge collection of wines which makes the evening more dusky...

“plush!”



Reviewed April 6, 2017



via mobile




The most beautiful bar in bangalore for sure!! beautifully done up interiors which is unique and also plush! I have had wonderful experiences at library bar meeting friends as well as business associates for many years now. One other thing is that a more elaborate menu for finger food is required and the current choice is a bit disappointing.

After a hectic day having a fresh brew - Aaahhhh that moment would be awesome.
I can able to relate the same thing here!
Although we enjoyed the beers here however the music needs a lot of improvement.
Don't know why the DJ - always looks outside instead of his console!

“Wonderful Singapore Street Food Festival”

Singapore is a small country which is known for being one of the prime Business hubs in the world. It is relatively a small country but then there are plenty of people living there making their livelihood in various ways other than being in Corporate World.

“Relaxing weekday evening”



Reviewed 2 days ago

This has now become the favorite place amongst the locals. Very difficult to find a place on weekends. Nachos can be found on almost every table... There may be limited craft beer options on weekdays but food will never disappoint you... They keep changing the menu from time to time... Must visit place for both beer and food lovers

“Heard a lot about Nagarjun but its a disappointment”



Reviewed March 30, 2017




Many recommended Nagarjuna Restaurant for Andhra Thali but its a disappointment. Its just the hype people created. Food is average and service below average. Its the advantage of location is what they are selling upon. Nagarjuna should realize that there is a lot of competition in the market now.

“One of Many, But good nonetheless”

There are lots of Barbeque Nation across the city and they all run like a standardized kitchen, nothing varies across them. So the review is basically for all the Barbeque nation in the town. The food is pretty good and all you can eat buffets are amazing for non-veg lovers, not so great for veg lovers. Nothing much to expect...

“Great local micro brewery with perfect setting”



Reviewed 3 weeks ago




Tried this local micro brewery - latest lounge fad. I am impressed with the beer quality and finger food. We also took a small brewery tour and the staff was very helpful explaining the beer making process. Quite neat and clean.
Try buffalo wings one of the best here even garlic bread was amazing.
They have happy hours for lunch...

“Decent buffet for office parties”



Reviewed yesterday
NEW 



The buffet served at this place is pretty basic with nothing unique. I would not come to this place again and again since the menu remains the same. In all the office outings we have been here, the buffet menu was the same. They need to think about adding something good and unique to it now.

“A Refreshing Oasis!”



Reviewed 1 week ago




An amazing and unexpected oasis serving the most delicious, fresh beer. The Indian Pale Ale is very authentic with a strong hoppy aroma, just so refreshing after a long afternoon touring the sights of Bangalore.
The pub is busy, but relaxed, the perfect place to unwind in the evening.
Highly recommended.

“Good Satvik food but can provide better value for money”



Reviewed February 1, 2017




The location of the restaurant is nice. Have a wide vegetarian choice.But some of the dishes made me feel that they are still experimenting with some recipes like Guava curry. Other dishes were OK but nowhere authentic.
Overall the price is not justified for the quality of the food

They were playing my fav Boney M albeit too loudly and the diner crowd was perhaps ecstatic about it forgetting the serene settings and all etiquette. It totally spoiled the mood - don't know...

I have been a regular visitor here. The main reasons for us to visit here is the food and service. Chef Sanjay interacts with guests and suggests food according to our taste. He had also prepared special items when we had stayed at the hotel. Great food and the breakfast buffet is awesome

Don't get confused by stores in the name, this is a nice little eatery for some delicious southern food. I like to dig into yummy masala dosa plus coffee if I'm around during evenings. Price is a bit on the uppish side though.

“Excellent Brunch Buffet ”



Reviewed 1 week ago



via mobile




The place offers excellent food and very wide variety for the Sunday Brunch. The only thing that needs improvement is the Sushi Bar, which was not upto the mark. It is a tad expensive at over RS 3000 per head (non alcoholic) (including taxes).

The Only Place consistently proves its only relevance to be the new (and great) gelato shop in its compounds and the nostalgia for old Bangaloreans. The food, for a vegetarian, is extremely average and not memorable. The Only Place is definitely avoidable, unless you like cucumber in your penne arrabbiata.

“Pleasant food and good wine”



Reviewed 3 weeks ago



via mobile




The pasta here is really good. There's a good variety offered and the only place where I really enjoyed the Spaghetti aglio olio. The flavours are delicate and pleasing. The wine offering is fairly good too. I particularly like the Grover Shiraz Rosé.
Special mention for stuffed mushrooms.
The ambience is a bit dark and it can feel cramped.

Neat pub to visit with good selection
Had few laggers of local tasty beers,
Especially liked the smooth criminal.
Pros-
Quiet nice to chill out
Descent selection of beers and food,
Should definitely try the flamin chicken- it like chicken tikka with a tangy sauce.
Fish fingers must try
Cons-
Can easily slim you down 3 grand in few hours...

The pasta here is really good. There's a good variety offered and the only place where I really enjoyed the Spaghetti aglio olio. The flavours are delicate and pleasing. The wine offering is fairly good too. I particularly like the Grover Shiraz Rosé.
Special mention for stuffed mushrooms.
The ambience is a bit dark and it can feel cramped.

Though it has a micro brewery, it good place for family with kids who do not drink as well.
The space and the ambience is enjoyable for kids, but would suggest afternoon rather than night if going with kids.

I was alone and was looking for some vegetarian buffet. Sattvam was advised by a local friend.
It's heaven for vegetarians. So many varieties to choose from and all tastes good.
Snakes, soft drinks, main course & deserts all were excellent. Specially there service.
All at fixed price and unlimited food.
Will definitely go again.

“always a pleasure!”



Reviewed April 5, 2017



via mobile




always a pleasure to lounge at the polo club! just had a short business meeting and ended downing an australian red..the place is airy and a place frequented by corporates and foreigners. A beautiful vibe and charming place with professional staff extending service and courtesy! the only negative thing is the mosquito menace that makes you wanna leave the place.

“Khap Khun Khap”



Reviewed February 6, 2017




Maybe the best Thai meal outside Thailand
Authentic recipes, skillfully crafted and tastefully served. Being set deep in the garden adds to the serenity and atmosphere best suited for enjoying classic Thai food.
And the fluent expression of the exciting relationship of palatte with professionally prepared prawn, pok choi and multi-hued peppers by the sous chef added to the enjoyment....

We ordered the chefs's special sandwiches - that was so yummy!
The service was fine but it could be better.

As usual my pitstop on weekends...Ala Carte is more preferable than their daily buffets. Indian chicken gravies are very good but frankly didn't think much of their buffets..although elaborate, many dishes don't taste that great..I still gotta try their Sunday brunch though. The ambience is a bit dark inside and gets noisy too..service is delayed at times.

“A Refreshing Oasis!”



Reviewed 1 week ago




An amazing and unexpected oasis serving the most delicious, fresh beer. The Indian Pale Ale is very authentic with a strong hoppy aroma, just so refreshing after a long afternoon touring the sights of Bangalore.
The pub is busy, but relaxed, the perfect place to unwind in the evening.
Highly recommended.

“Great place for a beer”



Reviewed February 13, 2017




Had a lovely English style ale with friend watching the world go by from the upper floor. This is a lovely bar and although we all only shared a bowl of fries the food that others were eating looked really nice.

Location: Restaurant is located off Sarjapur main road, not very difficult to find and enough parking space is there.
Ambience: This is the best part of the restaurant. Once you enter, you feel that you're on the sea shore. Place is very spacious and have multiple sections to sit down.
Food: Although I was aware of that being a vegetarian...

Reviewed 2 weeks ago




One of my favourite places when it comes to fine dining.
Being a vegetarian, finding good restaurants where there are good veg options is a difficult thing to do here in Bangalore. For me Toscano with their excellent thin crust pizzas, good pastas and the delicious Chocolate Kahlua Mousse makes this one of the better options in Bangalore.

We were surprised to see little bbq slots on our tables and seeing our menu on skewers being grilled in front of us.

“Good pan asian options, expensive”



Reviewed March 19, 2017




Here for an occasion we enjoyed their fares and the overall experience.The prawn Red Riot dish was super, though I found the Bun Bao to be unreasonably priced high. Definitely a good option if you want to move out of the usual Oriental = Chinese options, but I would reserve it for special occasions only.

Being a bit of a Hard Rock Cafe tragic, I find myself frequenting this establishment on a regular basis.
It is your typical HRC, with musical memorabilia donning the walls and music blasting through the speakers.
However, the building itself is really cool. I am guessing, but I think it is an old church (?) that has been tastefully converted...
