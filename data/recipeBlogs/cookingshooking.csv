        You can add in some cashews or nuts if you wish, some saffron water can go in as well. Cover the pan with the lid and heat it up in medium flame for 3-4 minutes, then about 20 minutes in low flame.     
                
            
        

            
        Let the biryani stay idle for a minimum of 30 minutes before opening. Open the pan, serve the biryani!    
                
            
        

    
        

    
        
    
                
        
            
        Recipe Notes    
                
        For a earthy flavor in the biryani, a pinch worth of Black Stone Flower or Daggad Fool can be added along with cardamom pods while making the masala. I personally skip in this biryani.

"Hyderabadi Veg Dum Biryani","http://cookingshooking.com/hyderabadi-veg-dum-biryani/","Hey Foodies,
Biryani, the pride of Hyderabad, is definitely one dish which everyone knows to cook in their very own ways and styles.

So, lets look into the detailed procedure of the much loved Hyderabadi delicacy, the vegetarian version. Oh yes, this is the Hyderabadi Dum Veg Biryani!
This recipe would take 380-400 grams of uncooked Basmati rice which would serve 6.

   Print  Hyderabadi Veg Dum Biryani    Recipe type: Main Course  Cuisine: Indian      Serves: 6     Ingredients  For Vegetables: Carrot - 1 medium Potatoes - 1 medium Paneer - ½ cup Cauliflower - ½ cup Green peas - 1 tbsp. Yogurt - ½ cup Mint - 1 tbsp. Coriander - 1 tbsp. Ginger-Garlic paste - 1 tsp. Green chili - 4 to 5 Oil - 2 tbsp Salt - As per taste Biryani Masala - 1 and ½ tbsp. Red Chili Powder - ½ tsp. Garam Masala Powder - ¼ tsp. Whole Garam Masala - Custom or readymade For Rice: Basmati Rice(soaked for 1 hour) - 380 gms Water - 6-8 cups Oil - 1-2 Tbsp. Whole Garam masala - Custom or readymade Salt - 3 Tsp. For Dum(Bringing together): Yogurt - ½ cup Saffron strands - dipped in milk, a few Chopped Nuts - As desired Mint and Coriander - two handfuls Fried onions - two handfuls Green chili - 4-5 slits Water - ¼ cup     Instructions  For Veggies: In a kadhai add oil. Now add whole garam masala, ginger-garlic paste. Saute for a minute. Now add carrot, potatoes, cauliflower, peas and salt. Saute until they are lightly cooked. After the veggies are a bit cooked, add in biryani masala, red chili powder, garam masala powder and gradually add yogurt stirring well to prevent curdling of curd. Now add mint, coriander, paneer. Cook until the moisture gets dried out which was caused due to adding yogurt. This would take approx 5 minutes. Veggies should not be cooked completely as we will dum it later on. It should 70% cooked. After the moisture is dried, add some fried onions and transfer to a bowl. For Rice: Boil water. Add oil, whole garam masala, salt. Boil until roaring boil. Add the soaked rice. In about 3-4 minutes in high flame rice will be 70% done. Test by eating some if it has a bite but its tastes like cooked or press between ur fingers. If breaks into 2 parts its ready. Strain it and spread on a big plate. For Dum: Take a cooker, add half of the vegetables, yogurt, green chilli, a pinch of salt and some nuts. Let it heat. Now add a handful of mint coriander. Now top it off with a good layer of rice. Next add the remaining vegetables, remaining mint-coriander(leave 1 tsp. for top), fried onions and the rice. Spread the rice and add the saffron mixture with a bit of mint-coriander, fried onion. Now sprinkle ¼ cup of water over it, Cover and cook for 2 minutes in lowest flame. Transfer the cooker to a big pot with some water. This water bath prevents the dum to get burnt.. In about 30-35 minutes the Biryani is ready to make you dig into it.     Notes Cut vegetables in a uniform size.
Veggies are less, but the rice is used more for Biryanis.
You could use raw chopped nuts or saute them in oil and add.
Make sure to soak rice for atleast 1 hour.   3.2.1311

Get your ingredients ready!!

   Print  Black Forest Cake - Eggless Baking Without Oven        Serves: 6     Ingredients  Dry Ingredients: All Purpose Flour - 1 Cup Cocoa Powder - 3-4 Tbsp Powdered Sugar - ¼ Cup Baking Soda - ¼ Tsp Baking Powder - ½ Tsp Wet Ingredients: Butter - ⅓ Cup Condensed Milk - ½ Cup Vanilla Extract - 1 Tsp Milk/Hotwater - As required Salt - 1-2 Cup Icing: Whipping Cream - 550-600ml Powder Sugar - 5-6 Tbsp Vanilla - If desired Filing: Red Cherries - ¼ Cup Syrup: Syrup from Cherry tin - ½ Cup Sugar - 4 Tbsp Shavings: Chocolate Bar - As required Red Cherries for top - 8-10     Instructions  Sponge: Add the salt to a cooker, use a idli cooker or a normal cooker(without whistle). Then keep a rack, cover and heat in low flame! Take a bowl and add in the room temp. butter, beat it. Then add the sugar and cream until light and fluffy. Takes 2-3 mins! Now add condensed milk, whisk for good 3-5 mins. Take a sieve and sift in the flour, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda. Fold the flour into the wet ingredients using a spatula or a spoon. Slowly add in Milk or hot water and make a smooth dropping consistency batter. Apply butter to a cake tin preferably a 6"" or 7""(depending upon height required) or a steel/aluminium container of such diameter. Then a butter paper(for smooth, perfect, cake!) in the bottom and again butter it. Add the batter to the cake tin and then tap it twice! Keep the tin in the cooker which must be preheated by now, Cover it and make sure its in low flame! Bake for 25-30 mins*. Check after 25 mins with a toothpick, if the toothpick comes out clean, cake is ready! If not, bake for another 5 mins. After cake is baked, take it out and let it cool for 10 mins. Loosen the sides with a knife and then transfer the cake into a plate then a cooling rack! Chocolate Sponge is ready. Icing: Chill a stainless steel bowl and a wire whisk in freezer for about 15-30 mins. Also make sure the cream is chilled! Add the chilled cream, powdered sugar and vanilla(i don't prefer) to the chilled bowl and whisk until soft peaks! Then keep the cream in the fridge for another 15-20 mins and then beat for 3-5 mins or until stiff peaks! Whipped Cream is ready! Filling: Take the cherries and crush them lightly to take the seed out! Syrup: Take out syrup from cherry tins. Add sugar to it and then heat until sugar melts! Don't over heat, just until sugar melts. Shavings: Take dark compound chocolate bar and peel it with a peeler! After peeling, freeze for 10 mins or more so that they get stiff and its easy to crush and apply! Lets Assemble: Take 3-5 bowls and keep a plate over it. Or simply use a turn table! Cut cake into three layer horizontally by turning the table. Transfer the layers to a plate. Touch the turn table with cream to ensure safe decoration and then add the bottom sponge layer to it. Spread 3-4 tbsp of syrup to it. Spread a good ½ inch layer of cream to it. Then some cherries. Now the middle layer, syrup, cream and cherries. Now the final layer, keep it upside down and then spread syrup!Take a big dollop of stiff cream and then spread it on top as well on sides. Then make it smooth! If crumbs are seen, do a crumb coat! Keep the cake in freezer for 10 mins(optional). Makes easier to transfer to serving base! Transfer the cake to Cake base using palette knife. Be careful! Now add the remaining cream to a piping bag fitted with a star nozzle. Pipe with circular motion on top which makes rosettes. And pipe and lift on bottom. Sprinkle chocolate shavings all over sides and top. A cherry on the top of each rosette! Its ready!     Notes Cocoa Powder Quantity: It depends upon quality. I would recommend to use 3.5 tbsp!
Milk/Hot water: You can use either one. I prefer both. About 2-3 Tbsp Milk and rest hot water. Using only milk can produce a milk chocolate type of taste!
Baking Time: It depends upon the stove.. It can take upto 45 mins.. But dont overbake.. Once the toothpick comes out clear, switch off the flame and take it out! Overbaking can result into hard cake!
Usually Kirsch(Cherry Rum) is used in this cake as a syrup. We are making at home, so we'll use the cherry syrup from tin!
You can use any of red cherries, black cherries, maraschino cherries. They are available in tins!   3.2.1311 
 

Chill and serve. I found that the taste enhances and the flavors of cherry is intense, sponge is soft and overall is deliciously delicious after 12 hours!
Enjoy..  Such an easy recipe, and its without oven.. Why are you hesitating? Very easy to make too.. And it tastes better than bakeries.. Also the comfort of making at home, Bake it.. I am sure you’ll love it.. And you will always make cakes at home from now on.. No excuses, Just make it!
Feel free to ask any queries! I will be very happy to answer them!

What has to be done, when you have the most number of requests for an ice cream? You gotta make it for them! 

Well, this Tender Coconut Ice Cream, “Natural Ice Creams Parlour” Style is the most requested ice cream since last year’s Beat the Heat / 7 Days 7 Ice Creams..

This ice cream is simple, but delightful & cools you instantly down! That’s the magic of the tender coconut, and surprisingly is easy to make.. So let’s start :

   Print  Tender Coconut Ice Cream Recipe ~ Naturals Style        Serves: 1.5 Liters (apx.)     Ingredients  Whipping Cream - 1 Cup Tender Coconut Water - 1¼ Cup Tender Coconut Meat - From 4 Coconut Milk - ¾ Cup Sugar - 1 Cup Condensed Milk - ½ Cup     Instructions  In a mixing bowl, add the whipping cream and whip it using a hand mixer or a whisk until stiff peaks. Add about ½ cup of tender coconut water and meat from 3 tender coconuts to a blender and blend to a smooth paste. Chop meat from 1 tender coconut into small pieces and keep aside. To the whipped cream, add powdered sugar, and mix well. Then incorporate - condensed milk, puree of tender coconut water & meat. Fold in the remaining ¾ cup tender coconut water along with ¾ cup of coconut milk to the mixture. And then add the chopped tender coconut meat, & transfer the ice cream into a bigger bowl(if necessary) and freeze the ice cream for a minimum 6 hours. Stir the ice cream after first two hours so that the tender coconut meat chunks are well distributed around the ice cream. After the ice cream is frozen, scoop out, serve & Beat the Heat!     Notes 1. Coconut Milk : You might be thinking why coconut milk in a *tender* coconut ice cream? Well, I've made it in three ways in past and it does taste great all three ways. This is just the moisture, not the meat part. Meat part was also changed. Those are: (a) Only Tender Coconut Water along with the usual ice cream base. (b) A little bit of Coconut Milk in. (c) this quantity. All three ways it taste good as I said, But (a) seems like something's missing and can be icy(not very creamy), and has a lot of tender coconut water flavor. (b) Better than before, but still needs more of that brought it better that is slight creaminess, balanced mild flavor. (c) I increased the quantity of coconut milk also the tc meat & voila. This is much much better! 
2. Sugar. I found the Natural Ice Cream Parlour's Tender Coconut Ice cream was way too sweet for my taste buds, I mean literally. If you wish, you can use more sugar in the ice cream, as I din't made the sweetness as much. As it was that sweet!   3.2.1311 





The sweet part(or I must say how much this Tender Coconut Ice Cream is relished), I was in Natural Ice Cream Parlour about 20 days back.. As soon as we entered, saw a kiddo(4-5 years) asking his mumma for another scoop of TC ice cream and continued.. That was surprising.. And I was the one who got the TC in all 4 of us rest the parlour was empty except he & his parents that time, and he started roaming around me & started poking me  His mumma said sorry and they left then  Well, that was sweet, but not as much the ice cream(way too sweet it was :P) Hope his mumma checks this recipe out & churns out this Ice Cream for him 

That’s all for today! Make & Beat the Heattt! Bye, there’s more coming soon!"
"Chenna Recipe | Indian Cooking Basics","http://cookingshooking.com/chenna-recipe-indian-food-basics/","Hey Foodies, 
Chenna Recipe here.. Its a quick post!
I have used this homemade recipe while making prasad for Lord Ganesha, recipe is Sandesh Modak which you can find it here.

   Print  Chenna Recipe| Indian Food Basics    Recipe type: Indian Basics  Cuisine: Indian         Ingredients  Fresh non-homogenized milk - 500ml Lemon Juice - 2 Tbsp. Water - 2 Tbsp.     Instructions  Take milk, and boil it in medium flame stirring occasionally to prevent the cream from separating. As it boils, switch off the flame and then keep stirring until 30 secs or so. Now gradually add the lemon juice. Add 2 tsp at first then stir for 20 secs or so, then keep on adding 1 tsp and stirring until it curdles. If you add excess lemon juice it can lead into stiff/chewy/hard chenna. Take a bowl, keep a strainer/colander on top of that and then line a wet cheese cloth/muslin cloth. Wet cloth will not wobble/move. Strain the chenna as soon as possible. if you keep the chenna sitting there it can get chewy/hard. Now add about 1 cup or more of cold water to the chenna. This will cool the chenna also will get rid of the pungent lemon smell. Gather the sides and then squeeze water slowly.. Dont add much pressure. Squeeze least amount of pressure... Dont take out all the whey from it here. Dont throw the whey, see tips/notes! Hang this in a tap or a kitchen cupboard handle and let the whey drop for a hour or two. Now open and use as required!!     Notes Make sure to stir milk occasionally to prevent the separation of cream. 
As soon as it boils, make sure to let it cool for some time or about 1 minute. Then add the lemon juice to curdle. This will make sure that you get soft chenna. 
You can use citric acid or vinegar in place of lemon. But lemon works best!!
For making rasgullas, moisture content of the chenna is the main key.. if its wet, they can mix with syrup if very dry they can come out dry.. So make sure to hand it for 1 hour or more and let the chenna moisture drain on its own.
Whey: Guys, trust me this is very versatile.. Dont throw it at all. 
Use it as veg stock it any dish, and see the magic. i prefer in sambhar, it takes it to another level.
Make ur pizza, chapati, naan, bread or any kind of dough using this.. 
Use this to make Kadhi. 
Drink it, its proteinous.
Keep it in counter for 3-4 days that'll make it even sour. Then curdle the milk again using this for even softer chenna.
In all there are many many uses of this whey.. Dont throw it at all!   3.2.1311 
Do let me know the outcome whenever you try this recipe. And, do drop in your valuable feedback in the comments section below and you could also send me a recipe request (Vegetarian only :P)

        Add in 2tbsp stevia, 2tbsp cocoa powder and mix all together. While mixing, pour in 1 1/2 cups of milk and 1/2 tsp of vanilla essence.     
                
            
        

            
        Once the batter is smooth, add in the chopped dates and mix well.    
                
            
        

            
         Pour the batter into the cake tin, top well with chopped pistachios. And transfer the cake tin to the hot cooker and let this bake inside for 40 minutes in low-medium flame.
    
                
            
        

            
        Since this batter has a lot of dates, it might take 5-10 minutes more or less for baking. Check at 35 minutes, and increase thereafter.    
                
            
        

            
        Once baked, take out and let cool completely. Slice up & serve!

Making an atta cake is that easy. Now why don’t you try it out and share a virtual treat with me?
The cake is irresistibly delicious, one literally cannot judge if there is any sugar added. I agree, there is a lot of sugar in this cake in the form of dates and stevia. But that’s natural, and not refined white sugar. And you can easily decrease the amount. Stevia is optional to add, but I like the touch of bitterness it gives in this, that just spikes the sweetness 

That’s all for today, Keep cooking & stay fantastic!"

"Make Whipped Cream from Chickpeas / Cholle | Aquafaba - Eggless Recipes Series","http://cookingshooking.com/recipe/wcaf/","Hey Foodies,
Whipping cream is a thing we face a lot of problems finding it.. Specially the availability in India is bad, easily only available in big cities and that too mostly only for Industrial purposes.. The second issue we vegetarians face is making recipes without eggs..


Worry not, there’s a new revolutionary(Sounds like a marketing gig but not at all, it’s true keep reading) egg replacer in market your own kitchen that not only replaces eggs very well in normal recipes but whips very well to make meringues, macaroons, and many more recipes..

 
What is it and more about it :

It is aquafaba. Aquafaba means – Bean Water. The liquid which we get after cooking beans/chickpeas or the brine/water from the can of chickpeas/beans. No complexions, Extremely simple.


It can be made at home very well using almost beans, better to use chickpeas/cholle as they are very neutral in flavor.

More about Aquafaba :

When we cook/boil chickpeas/beans, the water that is left behind is the aquafaba. It has a very similar protein structure to egg whites and also has a few properties similar to yolk..

It works as an emulsifier, leavening agent, foaming agent.. So great stuff many of us used to throw away earlier.. History – In December 2014, Mr Joël Roessel discovered about it through a investigation and blogged about it – revolutionvegetale.com

In Feb 2015 – Mr Goose Wohlt who is a software engineer in the states discovered and started working on it.. Soon in March he shared about it in a Facebook group and then created a new group for the same : Vegan Meringue Hits & Misses. (Join the group for more stuff about this)

That’s how it all started and since then it has been a storm in the social media.. You can read more about aquafaba here : www.aquafaba.com.. Also donate if you can to help fund a phytochemical analysis take place about it.. If you can’t, please share the word 
More about me working with it..

Aquafaba had started popping in my news feeds & more places in early May 2015 but I had not taken interest in it.. June is when I got interested & started finding more about it and started working on it.. Everything dint start well..
My First Attempt : I made the aquafaba, started whipping it.. No, It just wont. It dint whip it all.. Even after whipping for over 30 minutes..
Second : Same story, Dint gave up.. Tried again, strained the aquafaba twice to make sure nothing is there.. Choice of bowl was also not good, it was way too wide.
Third : Thickened the aquafaba, Slight Ray of hope but not so well.. It whipped a bit.. Pic from my third attempt.. Please excuse the image quality of my experiment images, they were a quick snap with bad settings, bad lighting and all..

Fourth : Finally, it whipped. And I made more, and was just admiring it and it all finished. Remember, it was just from 2 tbsp aquafaba 
Fifth : Tried making meringues, total disaster. They all melted. Found Reason after making 4 more times : Was not whipped enough, and oven temperature too high.
Ninth Attempt : Yuhoo, On cloud nine when I successfully made these. Not perfect, but yes I did it.
  
Tenth onwards : Started Flavoring and making more versions, playing around with oven temperatures, aquafaba thickness, how much to whip and more.. Also started working on other recipes..
  
 
For now, let’s get to making whipped cream substitute.. There are other ways of working with aquafaba which I’ll share soon.. And If I’ve missed anything in the post to put up which I should, I will update it very soon.. Wrote this late night in half sleep, will update this post as often as I can with more stuff 

Recipe Makes 2 Cups of Aqua Faba.
I use 1/4 cup of aquafaba with 1/4 cup sugar and whip it, and it is a little over 1 1/4 cups of whipped cream substitute. Feel Free to adjust as you need to.

        Instructions    
                
        
    
            
        For 2 Cups Aquafaba    
                
        
    
            
        Soak 3 cups Chickpeas/Cholle in 8 cups of water for a minimum of 8 hours.     
                
            
        

            
        Then get rid of the water it was soaked it in, and add the chickpeas to a pressure cooker with 4 cups of fresh water. Cover and Cook in Med-High Flame for 8 Whistles, then 20-25 mins in medium-low flame.     
                
            
        

            
        Switch off the flame, and let it stay undisturbed for a minimum of 2 hours and maximum 5 hours. Let the pressure release naturally. After that, open the cooker, and drain the chickpeas in colander above a bowl. I prefer to let this stay for another hour or two. After keeping for an hour or two or more, it might start to coagulate, just give it a good stir and you're good!    
                
            
        

            
        The water collected below is the aquafaba. Aquafaba is all ready to use in any recipe now.     
                
            
        

            
        Since it is too much to use at once for me, I pour this into ice trays(about 1 tbsp of it each) and freeze. That way it's ready for me to use anytime.     
                
            
        

    
        

            
        For 1 1/4 Cups Whipped Cream Substitute    
                
        
    
            
        In a deep but narrow from bottom bowl : Add 4 tbsp aquafaba. If ice cubes, thaw 4 tbsp equivalent.     
                
            
        

            
        Add 4 tbsp powdered sugar. Using a Hand Mixer or a Stand Mixer, start whipping it. Start slowly, and increase speed very slowly. It will take 10-12 minutes to start getting stiff peaks using this method.     
                
            
        

            
        I use a 6 speed Hand Mixer and Increase Speed from 1 to 2 at 1:30. From 2 to 3 at 3:00 Minutes. 3 to 4 at 4:00 and 5, 6 so on.. I use it till 7 minutes, and let it rest for 2 minutes. After that whip at full speed until stiff peaks which happen by 10:00 Minutes, sometimes it takes 12:00 Minutes.    
                
            
        

            
        That's all, your Whipped Cream Substitute is all ready. Use it in cakes, cupcakes, trifles, pastries, or any dessert     
                
            
        

    
        

    
        
    
                
        
            
        Recipe Notes    
                
        
There is no overwhip thing. This can be whipped for more time if its not getting whipped.
Highly recommended to use a machine to whip it.
Keeping Cooker for Minimum 2 hrs - Max 5 hrs. Make sure you do not exceed 5 hours, actually just drain it out at 3 hrs. Because keeping it for long will result in the chickpeas soaking the liquid and the aquafaba thickening then and there while the chickpeas soak. It's going to be messy. And Less than 2 hrs is also not recommended.
Another methods are also there which I'm going to share soon!
A little vanilla essence can be added for flavoring. It is very neutral in flavor though..

        Recipe Notes    
                
        
Coconut Milk : You might be thinking why coconut milk in a *tender* coconut ice cream? Well, I've made it in three ways in past and it does taste great all three ways. This is just the moisture, not the meat part. Meat part was also changed. Those are: (a) Only Tender Coconut Water along with the usual ice cream base. (b) A little bit of Coconut Milk in. (c) this quantity. All three ways it taste good as I said, But (a) seems like something's missing and can be icy(not very creamy), and has a lot of tender coconut water flavor. (b) Better than before, but still needs more of that brought it better that is slight creaminess, balanced mild flavor. (c) I increased the quantity of coconut milk also the tc meat & voila. This is much much better!
Sugar. I found the Natural Ice Cream Parlour's Tender Coconut Ice cream was way too sweet for my taste buds, I mean literally. If you wish, you can use more sugar in the ice cream, as I din't made the sweetness as much. As it was that sweet!

The sweet part(or I must say how much this Tender Coconut Ice Cream is relished), I was in Natural Ice Cream Parlour about 20 days back.. As soon as we entered, saw a kiddo(4-5 years) asking his mumma for another scoop of TC ice cream and continued.. That was surprising.. And I was the one who got the TC in all 4 of us rest the parlour was empty except he & his parents that time, and he started roaming around me & started poking me  His mumma said sorry and they left then  Well, that was sweet, but not as much the ice cream(way too sweet it was :P) Hope his mumma checks this recipe out & churns out this Ice Cream for him 
That’s all for today! Make & Beat the Heattt! Bye, there’s more coming soon!"
"Eggless Ladi Pav Without Oven - Feather Soft Buns Recipe In Cooker - Eggless Baking Without Oven","http://cookingshooking.com/ladi-pav-cooker/","Hey Foodies,
Today, let’s make some Eggless Ladi Pav, Without Oven!

Exciting right? We’re going to be making it in cooker, and it is going to be great! And you know what? This is baked better than the oven baked, look at the sides and the bottom..!

 
The feather soft test, passed?

Let’s dig right into the easy recipe

   Print  Eggless Ladi Pav Without Oven - Feather Soft Buns Recipe In Cooker - Eggless Baking Without Oven           Ingredients  Milk - 100ml Yeast - 1 Tsp Sugar - ½ Tbsp Maida / Plain Flour - 125g / 1 Cup Salt - ½ Tsp Milk Powder - 1 Tbsp / 9gms Butter - 10 gms / 2 tsps Milk & Butter - For Brushing Salt - 2 Cups for Baking     Instructions  To the warm milk, add the sugar and the yeast. Stir and keep aside to proof for 10 mins. In your working platform, place the flour, salt and the milk powder. Mix and make a well in center. Add the proofed yeast mixture, which would have been frothy so far. Get your hands in and form this into a soft-pasty kind of dough. If the mixture does not turn out to be soft and pasty-sticky consistency, add more milk to it and make it sticky and soft. Add in the butter and start kneading it. Knead this by pushing the dough with heel of your palm.. This is going to be very sticky and kind of paste like, but this is how it is supposed to be. Just keep kneading and scraping once in a while for 15 minutes. After about 15 mins of kneading, this will come together and would be more like a dough than a sticky pasty mass. Place this into a bowl with a lil bit of oil, coat the dough and the bowl with the oil, cover with a damp cloth and let it proof for 1 hour or until doubled in a warm spot. Once doubled in volume, punch and take the dough out, sprinkle a bit of flour and knead for a minute. Divide the dough into 6 equal portions. My dough weighed 245 grams. And I portioned about 40gms each. Smooth-en out each portion by rolling them between your palm and fingers. Place the shaped portions in a 6"" square cake tin. You can make in a round one as well. Cover the cake tin with a cloth and let the pavs proof for another hour or until well risen. For Baking Without Oven, I recommend to use a large Pressure Cooker. Remove the Rubber Gasket and Whistle. Add 2 cups of salt, a wire stand and a perforated plate. Cover and heat in Medium-High Flame. Quite on the higher side. Preheat for 10 minutes Once the pavs are well risen, and are parallel or above to the tin's height. Brush them with milk. Using a tong, place the tin inside the cooker and quickly close the lid/cover. Bake these for 15-18 minutes in Medium-High Flame.(Read Notes) Take them out once they're baked well.. Brush the tops with butter. Now take a damp cloth and cover the tin for a minimum of 30 minutes.(Read Notes) Using a knife, loosen the sides and carefully take the pavs out.. Pavs are ready.. Freshness to vouch for - smells, looks, and tastes heavenly! Enjoy!     Notes Making Ladi Pav or any Bread at home isn't difficult. But can get tricky when making without oven. Here are a few points for you to look at:
-> The size and the height of the tin matters. Make sure the height of the cake tin is no more than 2"". You want the pavs when prooved to be parallel or above the tin's height for them to brown well inside the cooker.
-> Flame : The flame that we use to bake cakes is low-med quite on the low side. But for baking these pav, you need to have the flame in med-high. Quite on the higher side. 
-> Browning : A good brushing of milk is usually enough for it. But, But, if you are not confident whether they will brown well or not, you can add a pinch of sugar and mix the sugar in the milk and then brush the pavs. The sugar will help in browning much better. But be careful, too much sugar can lead to over-browning/burning. Just a pinch is good.
-> Make sure to remove the gasket/rubber thing of your pressure cooker. 
-> As the heat is going to be quite on the higher side, be careful. And i will suggest to use old salt. I mean, use salt that you have used earlier to bake something else.
->   3.2.1311 





These are amazing, whatever you serve these with or just gobble as they are.. The goodness of freshly homemade bread is to die for.. Specially when its Pav.. So, If you had been thinking how to bake these without oven.. Stop thinking, go and make these and Enjoy 
That’s all for today.. Bye"

   Print  Melting Moments Cookies Recipe // Melt in Mouth | Eggless Baking Without Oven           Ingredients  Hydrogenated Vegetable Fat / Butter / Margarine - 100gms Powdered Sugar - 65gms Vanilla - 1 Tsp Milk - 1 Tbsp Corn Flour / Custard Powder - 30g Plain Flour / Maida - 100g + 2Tbsp(to dust) Salt - 2 Cups {To Bake in cooker} Chopped Pistachio - 2 Tbsp     Instructions  To a mixing bowl, add the fat and sugar, start beating it/cream until fluffy. Add the milk and vanilla, and mix well.. Add in the custard powder and maida and get your hands in to make a sticky mass of dough, just mix till combined, dont knead! Cover and refrigerate for 30 mins / freezer for 10 mins. #For Baking in cooker - Heat up a idli cooker / pressure cooker with 2 cups salt, a wire stand and a perforated plate for 10 mins. Remove the whistle if using pressure cooker.. ##For Baking in Oven : Preheat your oven to 180 C for 10 mins. Dust your working surface with some flour and get the dough out and smooth it out.. Feel free to make the cookies in any way, either make small portions of this and place on a baking tray or roll it out to ½ inch and cut it out using cookie cutters.. Place on a baking tray or a 7"" cake tin(for cooker) lined with butter paper and sprinkle chopped pistachio and press little.. Place the trays in the cooker / oven and bake for 10-12 mins. Let them cool in the tray and enjoy!     Notes Wanna prevent them from spreading too much? Freeze the cookies for 10 mins before baking 
I got Hydrogenated Vegetable Fat from a baker friend of my dad.. It comes in large tins(Starts from 5 kg or so i dunno :P) but he was kind enough to share a kg with me, Hindustan Unilever makes this.. 
Dont worry, you can easily use butter, margarine, or even shortening in this recipe without thinking and it would come out great just would take less or more time to depending upon the fat used    3.2.1311 




I baked three batches of this, and all finished within 48 hrs  Make sure you bake a good batch

"Shahi Tukda Recipe - Delicious & Healthier in 20 minutes | Healthier Indian Desserts","http://cookingshooking.com/shahi-tukda-hid/","Hey Foodies,
There are a lot of times when you have guests over and you want to serve them something quick and fast, but it should be delish!

My aunt(or my dear Mamiji) served me this last time when I visited her.. She is a workhorse in cooking I must say, ask her anything to make and she’ll churn out for you in the least time possible, with the best taste and twists! She heard me & my dad talking about Shahi Tukda a night earlier, and voila next morning’s breakfast is sorted for her  Okay, let me share how she made, She had used an cookie cutter to cut the bread pieces and then toasted them.. Then she made some thin rabri(usual method), and served in a bowl.. It was delish!

So a few days back, I thought to make this, but I was aiming to make this in a time-limit of 20 mins.. So, I made it by toasting bread in ghee, then making rabri using condensed milk+milk.. And also skipped the sugar syrup.. First two attempts were awry, but things were sorted on the third, and was delish.. So here it is, Let’s dig in to the recipe..

   Print  Shahi Tukda Recipe - Delicious & Healthier in 20 minutes | Healthier Indian Desserts           Ingredients  Milk - 1½ Cups (Full Fat) Condensed Milk - ½ Cup Bread Slices - 2 Ghee - 4-5 Tsp Cardamom - 3-4 Saffron - few strands Ghee - 4-5 tsp Cashews, Almonds, Raisins - few Edible Silver Leaf - to garnish (opt.)     Instructions  Start by heating the milk in a wide big pan in high flame. Stir it once in a while. Heat up another pan, add 2 tsp ghee along with the cashews and almonds.. Stir and shallow fry the nuts until light golden. Then add the raisins and continue stirring until they puff up, take down the nuts to a bowl. Keep an eye on the milk, and stir it often. Toast/shallow fry the bread in the renaming ghee from the nuts.. Once the one side is brown, pour in about ½ tsp ghee in the uncooked side and flip and toast.. Add in the kesar to the milk, and stir it & keep on reducing.. (Timestamp : 8 mins) After 2-3 minutes of the kesar being added, add the condensed milk to the milk and stir it.. And we're going to cook this for another 5 minutes..(Timestamp : About 10 mins) Take the bread out from the pan after its done, then toast another bread, same way.. Just pour in some ghee in each side before toasting.. Keep stirring the milk often after adding the condensed milk to prevent it from sticking & burning to the bottom.. Crush the cardamom pods to make a powder.. The second slice of bread must have been done now, take it down.. After about 15 minutes have passed, and the rabri looks thick and bubbly, it's all ready! Lower the flame, add the cardamom powder and mix.. Switch off the flame! Cut the bread slices into small triangles, also rough chop the fried nuts. In a plate, place the bread, scatter a few chopped nuts then pour over some rabri.. Add some almond slivers, kesar and edible silver leaf.. Enjoy the heavenly delicacy     3.2.1311

   Print  Eggless Chocolate Cake in Microwave(Less than 5 mins) With Hand Whipped Amul Cream           Ingredients  For Chocolate Cake - Milk - ¾ Cup Vinegar - ¾ Tbsp Vanilla Essence - ½ Tsp Oil - 3 Tbsp Flour - ¾ Cup Powdered Sugar - ¾ Cup Corn Flour - 1 Tbsp Cocoa Powder - 2 Tbsp Baking Soda - ½ Tsp Oil - To Grease For Icing - Amul Cream - 2 Packs of 200 ml. Powdered Sugar - ¼ Cup Dark Chocolate - 150 grams For Assembling: Cocoa Powder - ½ Tsp Sugar - 3 Tbsp Cherries - 10-12 Melted Dark Chocolate - 50g Melted White Chocolate - 50g Dark Chocolate - For Making Shavings White Chocolate - For Making Shavings     Instructions  In a bowl, add the milk, vinegar, vanilla essence, and oil and mix well. To a mixing bowl, add the flour, powdered sugar, corn flour, cocoa powder, baking soda and whisk to combine altogether. Pour in the wet mixture to the dry and whisk well. Grease a silicone cake tin / bowl of 6-7"" diameter with oil. Pour the batter in. Microwave the cake for 5 minutes. My was done in 4:30 minutes and my microwave is of 800watts. Check with a toothpick at about 4:30 if comes out clean, cake is ready. If not microwave for another 30 second. Take the cake out and let it cool to room temperature. If you wish to serve the cake as it is without cream, you can do it warm as well. For Icing, Refrigerate the 2 packs of cream for atleast 24 hours. DO NOT SHAKE THE PACK AT ANY POINT. Snip the top off, and scoop out the thick cream. Usually the cream is separated in the pack like thick cream on top and whey/thin cream in the bottom on the pack. Carefully take the thick part and add to a bowl which has been kept in freezer for 15 mins. In a bigger bowl, add some ice cubes and a little water and then place the bowl with cream. Start beating the cream to form peaks. It will take about 20 minutes to reach the thickness. Add powdered sugar and keep aside for a moment. Place 150g of dark chocolate in a microwave safe bowl and microwave it for 30 second, stir and repeat until completely melted. Once melted, keep aside till it cools off to room temperature. Add a little bit of cream to the chocolate and stir generously. Now add the chocolate mix to the cream and whip very well till its stiff enough. Refrigerate until ready to use. For Assembling - Take a turntable/place a big plate over a bowl. Place the cake, and slice the cake into two layers, keep aside. Mix ½ tsp cocoa, 3 tbsp sugar and 3 tbsp water and microwave for 2 mins. Let it cool to room temp. Place one layer of the cake in the turn table, smear the syrup and then add some cream. For easier application, i added my cream to a piping bag, then piped it. Scatter cherries, and place the another layer. Smear syrup and clot some cream and spread using a spoon for rustic homemade look! In a piping bag, add the dark and white chocolate and just put in a spoon/fork and take out to make a marble effect. If the chocolate is too fluid and warm, it will just pour out if you snip the tip of.. So just refrigerate the piping bag for 5 mins or wait for the chocolate to get a little cold and thick before adding to the piping bag. Snip the tip off the piping bag and pour the chocolate over the edges of the cake for that dribbling effect! Take dark chocolate for making shavings about 50 g, and peel it using a peeler to make shavings, Similarly do it with white chocolate. Scatter this over the cake and ENJOYYYYY!     Notes Note in Regard to the Stabilizing Amul Cream.. Make sure the cream is atleast whipped to soft peaks or thick enough as shown in video. Also make sure the chocolate is NOT warm/hot else it wont work. Cream should be cold.   3.2.1311 





I’m sorry for such a long recipe, but very easy it is.. Try it to believe! Taste is out of the world.. A pure chocolaty affair! <3 Enjoy!

"Pizza Base Recipe | Without Yeast and Oven | Eggless Baking Without Oven","http://cookingshooking.com/pizza-base-recipe-wyo-ebwo/","Hey Foodies,
Pizza, Pizza, Pizza!

We all get a pack of pizza base and make pizza in a jiffy.. Well, many reasons behind, some dont know how to make one at home, some dont get the so overhyped “Good Yeast” to make that and some just for the sake of the instant thingy!

 
Well, Here I bring my Pizza Base Recipe, its made without oven, its without any yeast, and ofcourse gets ready in 10 mins! And the freshness is out of the world! Also, you can add your favorite ingredient to the
base, from onions to basil! I’ve tried onion, garlic, basil. chili flakes, oregano and it tastes fantastic!

Let’s make pizza bases, 10 minutes in total and a fresh pizza base which tastes awesome!!

   Print  Pizza Base Recipe | Without Yeast and Oven | Eggless Baking Without Oven           Ingredients  Plain Flour/Maida - 1 Cup Yogurt - ½ Cup Baking Soda - ½ Tsp Baking Powder - ½ Tsp Salt - To Taste Mixed Herbs - ½ Tsp {Opt.} Olive Oil - 1½ Tbsp Plain Flour - For Dusting Salt - 1½ Cups {For Baking}     Instructions  Take a idli cooker or pressure cooker or any huge pot and add in the 1½ cups of salt to it. Spread it well and place a wire stand and put up a perforated plate over it. Cover and heat it up in med flame. Remove the whistle if using pressure cooker and loosen the whistle if using idli cooker. In a bowl or a kneading plate add the plain flour, salt, baking soda, baking powder and herbs{if using}. Mix well and add yogurt and make a sticky soft dough. Once dough is formed, add oil and knead for a minute. Divide the dough into two for 7"" medium thick pizza bases. Adjust if you want thin crust/thick or small/big pizzas. In a dusted platform roll the portion, if required dust some flour. Take a 7"" cake tin or any plate/utensil. Grease it well with some oil. Sprinkle some flour. Only flour also might work! I've not tested so far. but there's a risk of it getting stuck to the utensil/tin. Now prick some holes into it using a fork. Transfer this to the cooker/pan and quickly close it. Bake for 5-6 mins in medium flame. Take it out and enjoyy!     Notes As there is yogurt, I'd not suggesting storing this for more than 2 days. Do not refrigerate. 
If you have made normal dough without herbs and want to add herbs like i did for one. Just knead in the herbs to the dough!   3.2.1311 





Oh Yumm! Why buy that stale base when you can spend your just 10 mins for such an awesome base which you can customize as well!

"Pizza Uttapam | Alternative to Classic Pizza","http://cookingshooking.com/pizza-uttapam/","Hey Foodies,
When I first had the thought of preparing pizza uttapam, I and my family had expected this one to be like the normal uttapam taste with cheese. But, when I made this, we all were astonished with the outcome. Not only, it literally looked like a pizza, it does taste too. This is also one of the recipes which got published at the Deccan Chronicle, by the lovely Amrita di. And, I remember when she tasted this pizza, she din’t know that this was out of rice until it got over 
Pizza Uttapam is a healthy yet tasty alternative to our very own pizza. Touches from the south India make it truly stand out and keeping you safe from frequent consumption of maida which is not quite great for health.
Lets begin.

   Print  Triple Layered Mousse - Dark Chocolate, Mango, White Chocolate | Eggless Recipes           Ingredients  For Dark Chocolate Mousse: 150 Ml - Whipping Cream 75 Gm - Dark Chocolate 3 Tbsp - Powdered Sugar For Mango Mousse: 100 Ml - Whipping Cream 100 Ml - Mango Pulp 2 Tbsp - Sugar ⅓ Cup - Water 2 Gm - Agar/China Grass For White Chocolate Mousse: 150 Ml - Whipping Cream 75 Gm - White Chocolate 3 Tbsp - Sugar     Instructions  For White Chocolate Mousse: Boil water in a saucepan lower the flame and place a bowl over it and add in the white chocolate. Stir and melt it gently. As it melts, keep it aside or transfer into another bowl so that it cools down faster. In a mixing bowl, add the whipping cream and whip it to semi stiff peaks. Add the sugar and whip to stiff peaks. As the white chocolate cools to room temp, add a part of whipped cream to it and mix it well. By doing this we're tempering the cream so that the chocolate does not solidifies due to temperature shock and we get a creamy result at the end. Now add all the cream and give it a whiz. White chocolate mix is ready. For the Mango Mousse: Add the water to the agar agar. Let it soak for 10 mins. In a bowl add the cream and whip it to semi stiff peaks then put in the sugar then whip it to stiff peaks. In a pan, add the soaked agar and cook that in med flame stirring until everything well dissolves. In another pan heat the mango pulp until its quite hot. Add the dissolved agar to the hot mango pulp and mix well. Add this mix to the whipped cream and give it a gentle mix. Mango mousse is ready. For Dark Chocolate Mousse: Repeat the same as white chocolate. Small recap: Melt the Chocolate over a simmering water. Let it cool. Whip the cream, add sugar and whip till stiff peaks. Now temper the cream with chocolate then mix both well. Dark Chocolate Mousse is ready. Transfer these into individual disposable piping bags. Pipe the mousse as you prefer in shot glasses/decorative glasses. Chill for 2-3 hours before serving. Enjoy!    3.2.1311

आज में और मेरी माँ मिल कर मेरी दादी की मीठा आचार की रेसिपी बनायेंगे. ऐसे ही आम को घस कर चुंडा भी बनाया जाता है.. पर ये थोरा अलग है. 

ये अचार बहुत हि मज़ेदार है, और आप इसे रोटी के साथ तो खा ही सकते है पर चावल, ब्रेड, वगरह के साथ भी खा सकते है. ये चटपटा आचार आप चाहे तो ऐसे ही जैम जैसे या फिर चमच से ऐसे भी खा सकते है. इतना मजेदार है, तो चलिए बनाना शुरू करते है.




पहले मुझे और मेरी मा को बनानते हे देख लिजिये 

अचार बनने के लिए अपको चाहिए : 
सामग्री: 
कची केरी / कचा आम  – 3 बडे (निचे tips जरुर पढ़े)
नमक – 2 बड़े चमच या स्वाद अनुसार
चिनी / शक्कर – 1500 gram
मिर्ची पाउडर – 1 1/2 बड़े चमच (आप चाहे तो कश्मीरी लाल मिर्च भी उसे कर सकते है)
सौंफ – 1/2 बड़ा चमच
मेथी दाना – 1/2 बड़ा चमच
कलोंजी – 1 छोटा चमच
 
बनाने की विधि:
१. सबसे पहले कची कैरी को छील कर बड़े बड़े टुकडो में कट लीजिये. हमने ३ बड़े कोब्बरी(coconut) कैरी ली थी, जिसे काट कर नापा तो वह लगभग १५०० ग्राम थी.
२. एक बड़े बर्तन में जितनी कैरी उतनी ही चीनी मिला लीजिये. अची तरह मिलाने के बाद उसे धक् कर ४-५ घंटो के लिए कोने में रख दीजिये. इतने देर आम पानी छोड़ देगा और चीनी भी थोरी बहुत घुल जाएगी. ध्यान रखिये, आपको एक बूँद भी पानी नहीं डालना है.
३. लगभग ४-५ घंटे बाद, जब चीनी घुल जाये और चाशनी बन जाये तो उसे कम-से-माध्यम आच में चढ़ा दे और उसे लगातार चलते हुए पकाए.
४. लगातार चलाना आवश्यक है, नहीतो शुरू में निचे चीनी लग सकती है और बाद में आम चिपक के जल सकता है. इसलिए लगातार चलते रहिये.
५. लगभग २०-२५ मिनट बाद जब आम नरम हो जाये और थोरा रंग बदल जाये तब उसमे नमक, मिर्ची पाउडर, सौंफ, मेथी दाना, कलोंजी मिला दीजिये.
६. अब इसे लगातार चलते हुए अगले १०-१५ मिनट पकाइए. फिर इसे टेस्ट कीजिये की बन गया की नै. टेस्ट करने के लिए – एक प्याली को फ्रीजर में कुछ २-३ मिनट के लिए रख दीजिये. फिर उस प्लेट में अचार की कुछ बूँद डाल कर १०-१५ seconds के लिए रख दीजिये कोने में. फिर उसे देखिये, की वो अपनी जगह में है या फैल गया है. एकदम ज्यादा नै फैलना चाहिए, और एकदम बैठना भी नै चाहिए. लगभग २ तार की चाशनी होनी चाहिए.
७. टेस्ट करने के बाद, बन गया है तो गैस बंद कर दीजिये. और धक् कर १०-१२ घंटे के लीजिये डंडा होने दीजिये. आम का आचार डंडा होने के बाद उसे कांच के डब्बे में डाल कर आप १ साल तक आराम से खा सकते है. बनाइये और खाइए 
 
कुछ महत्त्वपूर्ण टिप्स: 
१. हमने ये आचार बनाने में कोब्बरी कैरी इस्तमाल की है. ये कैरी बड़ी होती है, और थोरी मीठी होती है. आपको ये ध्यान रखना है की कैरी कड़ी होनी चाहिए लेकिन एकदम खट्टी नहीं, थोरी मीठी.
२. ध्यान रखियेगा की आपको एक बूँद भी पानी नहीं डालना है कभी भी. पानी डालने से आचार ख़राब हो जायेगा. ये अपने खुद के रस में पकेगा, इसलिए हम इसे ४ घंटे के लिए चीनी में मिला कर रखते है.
३. इसमें मसाले मिलाने के बाद ध्यान रखिये, और लगातार चलते रहिये. ज्यादा पकाने से ये आचार चिड्दा(chewy) हो जायेगा.
 —
आचार बनाना बहुत आसान है, बस ये कुछ टिप्स याद रखिये और बनाइये खाइए और मज़े कीजिये. चाहे तो रोटी के साथ, कभी ब्रेड के साथ, कभी चावल के साथ, कभी मुरब्बे जैसे.. 
हमारे मित्रों के लिए निचे अब येही रेसिपी अंग्रेजी में दी गयी है.

It’s sweet, its sour, it’s spicy. Here’s some traditional sweet pickle recipe from my Granny.. Have you watched me & my mom make it? If not click here to see now! Let’s dive right into the recipe!

Ingredients:
Raw Mango : 3 Large (Read Tips)
Salt : 2 Tbsp / or to taste
Sugar : 1500g
Red Chili Powder : 1 1/2 Tbsp (I used a mix of kashmiri chili powder & normal chili powder)
Fennel Seeds : 1/2 Tbsp
Fenugreek Seeds : 1/2 Tbsp
Onion Seeds : 1 Tsp
Method:
1. First of all, peel & dice raw mango into big chunks. I used 3 big Kobbari(Coconut) Variety Mangoes and after dicing it came down to about 1500gms.
2. Transfer the mango chunks into a big stock-pot or utensil, and add same amount of sugar to it. Stir well and make sure sugar & mango chunks are well mixed. Then cover & let it rest for 4-5 hours.
3. After 4-5 hours, when the sugar is kind of dissolved & mango has released some good moisture heat this up in medium flame.
4. Stirring regularly to prevent sticking cook this stuff up until the mangoes chunks are soft & slightly translucent. Will take about 20-25 mins.
5. After the raw mango chunks are soft, puffy and slightly translucent add in the salt, red chili powder, fennel seeds, fenugreek seeds & onion seeds. Again, stirring regularly cook this in medium flame for another 10-15 minutes.
6. Test the pickle just like we test marmalade with a cold plate. To test : freeze a plate for 2-3 minutes. Then pour in a drop or two of the pickle in the plate. Let it rest for 10-15 seconds. It should not be runny, and not still as well. If it stays well, and is not extremely runny, pickle is ready.
7. Turn off the flame, cover the pot, and let it cool down naturally for 10-12 hours. After which, you can transfer it to glassware air tight containers & enjoy 
Few things to take care of / Important Tips :
1. At any stage, do not add even a drop of water. Water will spoil the pickle. We’re cooking this in Raw Mango’s own juices.
2. As stated earlier, I used Kobbari(coconut) Mangoes(sounds weird? :P). Kobbari Mangoes are Large, not very sour. All you need to make sure is the mango variety you are using isn’t very sour and also not soft. You will need a neutral kinda(not very sour, not sweet) tasting firm raw mangoes.
3. Make sure to not cook this too much, keep testing after 10 mins of adding the spices. Cooking too much will make the mango chunks chewy & rubbery.

Making the pickle is easy, just keep these tips on hand and choose right kinda raw mangoes and enjoy the finger licking good pickle all year..
That’s all for today, Hoping you’ll make this & enjoy! Thanks"

   Print  Homemade Butterscotch Sauce Recipe - Easy Basic Recipe | Perfect for Topping, Cakes & More           Ingredients  Sugar - 200gms Butter - 60gms Salt - ½ Tsp Cream - 200ml Milk - 100ml     Instructions  Mix Milk and Cream and keep aside. Start by heating a sauce pan, and add the sugar to it. Continuously stir over medium high heat until it caramelizes. if any lumps form, break them with the wooden spatula you're using. Be with it and keep stirring, don't heat and go away! This dry process of making caramel happens very fast! Flavor completely depends upon how much you caramelize the sugar. I did it till it was just done, amber golden color and started smoking a lil bit. Once caramel is done, switch off the flame and add in the butter & salt. Stir it well, it will froth so be careful. Now while stirring with one hand, add the milk and cream mixture a little bit. Stir well, and then start the flame in medium. Add the milk+cream mix lil at a time and keep stirring till most of the mix is added and the lumps are dissolved. Keep a little bit of the milk+cream mixture like about 3-4 tbsp of it aside. Once the butterscotch sauce is looking good and smooth and has started boiling a little bit, add that left milk+cream mixture stir well and get to a light simmer and switch off the flame. Keep the sauce aside to cool to room temperature. Use as desired.     Notes You can use 100ml of apple juice instead of the 100ml milk. And also add 100g of apple sauce or 100gms of apple grated if you wish to. 
I suggest to keep in refrigerator and bring it to room temp before using if you wish to store it, which it might keep very well for about a week or more. Freshness really is awesome, so make little and use asap    3.2.1311 





Making this sauce with white or brown sugar is your preference literally. I have tried many times in past using brown sugar, but i feel the flavor gets too strong atleast and sometimes a lil bitter as well for me & my family.. Using this white sugar brings a perfect taste and flavor and is sensational.. So all comes to you and your palate, whether to use white or brown  I’d suggest to use white 
Now, make some Butterscotch Cake or just top your Ice Cream with it or make or do whatever you wish for, but make sure to lick the bowl, saucepan and all 
That’s all for today,
Thanks"

Instructions  Heat up the milk in a wide pan and get it to a boil. In a small bowl, take out 1-2 tbsp of the boiled milk and add the saffron strands to this milk. Set it aside. Now, working on the milk, reduce the milk in a medium flame, stirring it occasionally to prevent burning. Stirring the milk evenly gives amazing texture to Kulfi. Add the soaked saffron to the reducing milk and stir it and reduce it till it becomes half of its original volume. Add the sugar and cream, and cook it for another 1-2 minutes. After reducing the milk, let it cool down completely. After it cools down, add mange pulp to it and the pistachio. Mix it well and add it to the Kulfi Moulds. After pouring it in the Kulfi Moulds, set it for 2 hours in the freezer. After 2 hours take it out, insert ice cream stick to each of the kulfi moulds and let it set again for 3-4 hours. Chill and Serve!    3.2.1311

        In a pan, add half a cup of sugar and heat in medium flame. Once the sugar starts melting, lower the flame. Once the caramel starts bubbling, switch off the flame and pour 1 and half cups of hot water to the caramel. Stir it really well and switch on the flame again.    
                
            
        

            
        After boiling the syrup for about a minute, add the candied fruits and dry fruits, which is around 270 gms of mixed fruits. Cook the mix for about 4-5 minutes in low flame. When the fruits are plump and caramel gets thickened, switch off the flame and cover the mix to cool down to natural temperature.

        In a mixing bowl, add the butter and condensed milk and whip it well. Once the mixture is fluffy, add some of the caramel syrup. Then add in the flour, baking soda, baking powder and almond powder. Mix well and add the soaked fruits. Once the batter is all ready, bring it all together.    
                
            
        

            
        Preheat the cooker in medium flame with 1-2 cups of salt. If baking in oven, preheat at 180 degrees.     
                
            
        

            
        Grease the muffin tins/mini bundt pan with some butter. Spoon the batter in moulds and sprinkle some almond powder on top.     
                
            
        

            
        Place in the cooker/oven. Baking time in cooker - around 30mins(for mini bundt pans). For oven, baking time-20min, after 10mins cover them with a foil(for muffin size).     
                
            
        

            
        After the mini plum cakes get baked, let them cool covered. Tastes best as they mature, hold your pangs for a minimum of 12 hours before digging in

"Sugar Free Rasgulla Recipe - Bengali Rasgulla with Sugar Free | Sugar Free Sweets","http://cookingshooking.com/sugar-free-rasgulla/","Hey, Here comes another sweet recipe, but this time its sugar free.  Now-a-days more and more people are not able to eat a lot of sugar.. Have been getting a lot of requests for Diabetic Friendly recipes.. So, I thought to start with this Sugar free Rasgulla.. Yes, Yes, I used Sugar Free Natura which is nothing but sucralose and having a lot of it isn’t a good thing for diabetics. But I believe, having one in once in a looonnngg while doesn’t matter much ya? I’m not very much known to diabetics to be true as noone in my family is diabetic.. You can use any Sucralose in this recipe.. And even cut down the sugar to half, that is add 10 grams of Sugar Free Substitute. Without any much delay, let’s get on to the recipe.

   Print  Sugar Free Rasgulla Recipe - Bengali Rasgulla with Sugar Free | Sugar Free Sweets           Ingredients  Fresh Raw Pure Cow Milk - 1½ Liter Sugar Free Natura - 19 Grams (READ NOTES) Lemon Juice - 2 Tbsp (Mixed with 2 tbsp water)     Instructions  Start by heating up the milk in a pan stirring regularly till it gets a boil. Shut off the flame, and let it cool for a minute. Slowly pour in the diluted lemon juice stirring well until it separates into whey and cheese/chenna. As soon as the milk curdles, strain it over a cheesecloth/muslin cloth which is lined in a colander over a bowl. Pour cold water over the cheese to get it cold and get rid of acidic taste/flavor. Gather the edges and squeeze lightly. Tie it somewhere like on faucet / drawer handle and let the whey drip and excess moisture leave out for 30 minutes. In a deep and wide vessel/pan add in 9 cups of water along with the sugar free substitute. Heat it up till it gets a roaring boil. Once the chenna has been dripping the moisture for 30 minutes, take it out and see if it lightly crumbles and breaks its ready otherwise squeeze out the moisture from it. There needs to be a little bit of moisture in the chenna, but it should not be wet either. Divide the chenna into equal sized balls. I made 15 out of it. Drop the balls in the vigorously boiling syrup and cover for 5 minutes. After 5 minutes, take the lid off and cook for another 10 minutes. Make sure the syrup if continuously boiling, adjust the flame accordingly. After it has been cooked for 15 minutes in total, take them out to a bowl with minimal syrup to cover them. Boil the remaining syrup for another 5 minutes and then pour all together to the boil. Let it cool to room temp, refrigerate then and enjoy!  Tastes best once rested for 7-8 hours, I prefer to make mine in evening and serve next day.     Notes I used Sugar Free Natura which comes in powder form. I DO NOT recommend you to use the sugar free tablets/pellets as they might bring a bitter taste. You can use any sugar free which is sucralose.
If you are thinking to cut down on sugar even more, feel free to add 10grams of it or even less.. But if you divide the sugar free and rasgullas, its less than 1 and a half sachets Per Rasgulla of sugar free that you usually add to your tea/coffee..   3.2.1311 



  This is a must for you to try, And I hope you will definitely try  No compromise on anything, just tastes fantastic!

"Momos Simply Veg | Appetizers","http://cookingshooking.com/momos-simply-veg-appetizers/","Veg Momos, aka Steamed Dumplings is one such thing that makes everyone crave from toddlers, to teenagers like me, to youth like my sissy, and adults like my dad.  And, every time we make it, we literally have a hard time rolling so many dumplings as we all love it so much. Jokes apart, Momos is traditionally a Tibetan dish, years after its popularity in the Tibet people in Nepal, Bhutan and North-eastern India have claimed it to be their dishes. No offences here guys. We respect food, let it come from anywhere. So, the below version is a simple recipe which you may find similar to some of the Veg Momo stalls in Darjeeling!
Guests coming in? Well, you can definitely make it for the appetizer. (Disheartening fact, Darjeeling street vendors sell 7-8 of these at INR 10-15 bucks, crazily low priced)

"Veg Chili Momos Recipe | Local Nepali Style | Momos Recipe","http://cookingshooking.com/chili-momos/","Dear Foodies,
Momos, or dumplings are one of its kind.. But this time, it’s double the delish ~ Chili Momos is here for you 

I have been to Kathmandu couple of times, and have stayed for a good time as well.. And, all after that I have a very big soft corner for the city, or I must say the Country Nepal.. This delicacy is very popular around Kathmandu & Nepal.. It’s just divine, but it’s damn spicy 

My version is slightly drier as a gravy sorta(that’s how I prefer), you can make it with gravy if you want so.. Also not as spicy as we get there.. So let’s get cooking, shall we?

After 2-3 minutes, the mixture will feel much more moist & it;ll start oozing moisture. Take some mixture in your hands, squeeze hard and put the mixture into another bowl. Like so, take out excess moisture from the mixture. See notes for uses of the liquid you are left with. To the cabbage mixture, add the oil and mix well. Filling is ready. Grease steamer plates with oil. Roll out the momo dough(see notes) into 3-4"" circles then place about ½ to 1 tsp of filling. Make plates till half(or until semicircle) as shown in video, then press the empty side of dough to the plates. Place into steamer racks. Make more momos like so, then steam for 10 mins in med flame. Let momos stand for 5 mins, then take them out of the steamer and let them cool completely, For the chili momo prep ; Heat up oil in a pan to fry the momos. Once hot, fry in high flame until golden. Keep aside. In a bowl mix - red momo chutney, vinegar, chili paste, soy sauce, ketchup. Heat up a wok, add 2-3 tbsp of oil. Once hot add the slit green chili, garlic. Stir once, then add the onion shells & toss for a minute. Add a pinch of salt & msg and toss. Pour down the sauce and ¼ tsp of sugar and cook for a minute. Add the fried momos, stir until momos are coated. Sprinkle a bit of scallions & coriander if you wish, then serve hot!     Notes 1. You can watch my momo recipe video for the dough recipe. Also the red chili chutney video, both are embedded below. 
2. Locals mostly make it with raw veggies, that's why I showed this method this time.
3. The liquid from the veggies is very nutritious & delectable.. You can drink it as it is, I do it all the time I drank all of it, I like it a lot! You can also make thupka, or soup with it.. Or use it as a stock if you wish! 
4. My mom has been making momos since like many years, like when I was 3-4 years I have been seeing her making.. In my family everyone loves momos, and so she used to make for us almost every week.. Now-a-days once in a month.. She used to say me, make loyi out of the dough(divide the dough into smaller portions).. I used to enjoy that  Experienced hands!   3.2.1311 




Fried momos with juicy filling with a spicy & garlicy sauce.. Double the delish for sure.. Make sure you try it, and do share how you liked the dish

"Motichoor Laddo Recipe | Perfect Motichur Laddus - Indian Sweet Secrets Revealed","http://cookingshooking.com/motichoorladdo/","Hey Foodies,
Motichoor Laddu, or Motichur Laddos is a weakness of many.. I mean literally, who doesn’t like these Laddus which are made up of Fried droplets/pearls of Chickpea Flour, simmered in sugar syrup and shaped into balls?
Image Shot the Next Morning.
These, right these, are homemade.. Don’t you agree? Try it to believe it.. As soon as I posted the Motichoor Donuts, the requests for this Motichoor Laddus instantly took a peak.. So here’s my Perfect Recipe for you to make the Real Motichoor Laddus.
Image shot after 2 hours being made.
I’m stressing on real, ask me why? Cause I’m just too skeptical about things.. Many of you might have gone through the recipes available online.. Mostly which either calls for Making Normal Boondi’s and crushing them in a food processer/blender or Soak the Mini Boondi’s in syrup like for Normal Boondi Laddus.. Common guys, these are special, These are made by making miniature pearls, then simmering in sugar syrup.. Look, Look at the pearls which, absolutely round, and perfect!
 
So, without talking much here’s the recipe and then the Tips & Tricks in the Notes Section.
WARNING : “Pretty Long Recipe Ahead, Go slow with patience.” 
If you feel the recipe is over-exaggerated, I’m sorry it needs to be, Watch the video first for a better understanding.
I presume, Motichoor Literally means the motis/pearls breaking easily. Choor is an Bengali Word I believe, and choor means break/crumble/crush.

   Print          Serves: 500grams     Ingredients  Besan / Chickpea Flour – 1 Cup / 125 grams [Coarse Variety] Water – 235 Ml [Or as required to make watery batter] Kesar Orange Food Color – Few Pinches Ghee – ¼ Tsp + For Frying Sugar – ⅔ Cups + ¼ Cup / 180 Grams Water – 90Ml Cream of Tartar / Tartari – 1 Small Pinch [Use 1-2 drop lemon juice/1 pinch citric acid instead] Rose Water – ½ Tsp Melon Seeds / Char Magaz – 1 ½ Tbsp {More or less}     Instructions  Start by mixing the besan, a pinch of kesar food color, ¼ tsp ghee in a bowl. Add water little by little and make a batter. Keep aside some of the water(if measured as shown), or make a medium thin batter using water as required. Let the batter rest for 15-20 minutes minimum. Add more water and make a super thin, “Watery” kind batter. Heat ghee to fry the Motichoor boondis, in a kadhai/pan. You’ll need a Jhara for making the miniature boondis, the finest one. Place a stand/container or some sort of thing near the pan with ghee. Make sure to keep a cloth below and above the container. The height of the container should be a couple inches above the pan. On the other side, keep a plate/tray where you’ll keep the fried boondis in. Above the plate, either keep a strainer or a colander so that the excessive ghee can come out. To make these miniature boondis, its advisable to have someone help you. To make these, you’ll need to consistently beat/hammer/tap down your jhara’s handle in the container and the face of jhara should be over the pan. While someone who is helping you would add a ladle full of the watery batter. And the miniature boondis would fall into the super-hot/little less hot than smoky ghee. As soon as you feel all the batter has been dropped into the hot ghee, take the boondis out from the ghee. I mean instantly take them out. You don’t want to over cook them, they’re smaller than a mustard and would cook in a second as the ghee is super hot as well. Keep the fried boondis over a colander/strainer. Like so, make the miniature boondis by smashing/hammering down the jhara’s stem/long handle over the container while someone adds a ladle full of batter to it and the boondis would fall into the super hot ghee and it’ll fry in a jiffy. Take them out and place in the strainer. Keep taking the boondis out from the strainer and keep in a bowl so that all boondis get a chance to leave the excess ghee. After all the boondis are made, let them rest for 10-15 minutes. To make the syrup, add the 180grams of sugar and 90ml of water in a pan. Add a pinch of kesar food color, a pinch of Cream of Tartar/Tartari and the rose water. Heat it up and let the sugar dissolve, and switch over to a very very low flame. If your stove doesn’t have a very slow flame, switch off the flame. The flame should be such low as its closed to being switched off. Add the boondis in and start stirring it. Cooking these boondis is a critical and tricky step, if you cook this less it won’t form into laddos and even if it forms it may remain kinda chewy and wet. If you cook it more, it’ll be hard and all the goodness of a melt in mouth motichoor would be void. Cook it in very very low flame, just until it starts leaving sides. If you had switched off flame, switch it on after 2 minutes to the lowest flame and Cook it till Just Starts Leaving Sides. Once done, switch off flame and cover and let it be like so for 5-6 minutes. Take the mixture out from the pan into a plate and spread it. Add the char magaz/melon seeds and let it cool down completely. You have two options; either make the laddus and keep them for 4-5 hours or let this mixture rest for 4-5 hours then make the laddus. I make as soon as it cools, then let them rest. I prefer to shape and then rest. Shape these into laddus and then cover these and let these rest for 4-5 hours minimum. More the better, but one cannot resist any more. By this time happens, the boondis get softer, sweeter and just like a motichoor laddo should be. As the time passes, and if you had made them before and let them rest which may result in slight odd shapes, you can roll them between your Ghee Greased/Wet Palms again to make them round and shiny. ENJOY!     Notes TIPS / Tricks / Do’s and Don’ts: 

Besan : For this recipe let me explain. Basically you need a coarse besan. Bombay Besan and the Normal/Coarse Besan are the normal two kinds. Bombay Besan is a fine variety of besan, usually used in the fritters. And the coarse variety which is ground coarse, specially used for Mithais, such as this, besan ki burfi, laddo and so on. Try to find the coarse variety and use it, if unable to you could try replacing 1½ tbsps of besan from 1 cup of besan with semolina/suji. Though, its best to find a coarse variety which is easily available. 


Thickness of Batter : Plays a important Role, Make sure the batter is of watery consistency. It Should Not Be Thick. If its thick, the jhara’s holes may get jammed or the batter may get a little collected beneath the holes resulting in thicker/bigger boondis. On the other hand, it should not be way too diluted, it should have a like consistency. 


Consistency in Tapping : Make sure you tap/hammer your jhara’s long handle in the container/stand consistently. If you do it slowly, you may get a Fried Pancake or Lumps of Boondi / Large Boondis. *DO THIS UNDER ADULT SUPERVISION IF YOU’RE NOT AN ADULT LIKE I DID.* Be paitent, and don’t rush there’s smoky hot ghee which you’re working with.


Frying the boondis : These motichoor boondis are even smaller and a mustard and the ghee is as hot as it would smoke which means as soon as it goes to the ghee it gets cooked in a jiffy. Make sure you take them out instantly. Also make sure you let the boondis get rid of excess ghee. And time to time transfer the boondis to a bowl so that all the boondis are excess-ghee-free. 


The syrup : As soon as the sugar melts transfer to a very very low flame and add in the fried motichoor boondis. For the moti(s) to choor you need to cook them in such a way that they absorb the syrup and get soft. I presume, the mithaiwalas make in a large quantity which means the syrup cools down tremendously and then takes a good time and the boondis get cooked well and soak the syrup well. At home, you need to either switch off the flame and add the boondis and after two minutes turn it on to the lowest flame or place it in such a flame that it is close to the flame being switched off. My hob has a very small burner I used that. 
Cooking this mixture till such that it starts leaving sides may turn these laddos dry, which motichoors aren’t. So you need to use something acidic, which will prevent the crystallization/drying of it. You can use a drop of lemon juice or citric acid or a tiny pinch of cream of tartar or as popularly known in hindi as “tartari”. One way of testing whether the cooking in syrup is done or not is by “grabing a boondi and pressing/trying to choor the boondi.” If it choors well its ready. Note : The known texture of super soft and melt in mouth is going to come with time. The boondis of the motichoor laddo would go even softer and as found in shops as you keep it to rest, it is kinda firm when you shape it. 


The final wait : You need to either keep the mixture for quite a time like for 4-5 hours or shape the laddus then keep them for atleast 4-5 hours. This does many things; Mingles the flavors; Makes the boondies super soft and melt in mouth and just like available in market which now may be a little firm; laddos would get sweeter.   3.2.1311 





 
So, If you are still with me, That was my perfectt recipe to make Motichoor Laddus.. Perfect round miniature boondis simmered in sugar syrup! Make and enjoyy..  This was again a recipe, that took a lot of time and effort to develop.. Specially more effort.. Finally, one day tried making with thin batter and it came great! So, definitely takes some effort but is out of the world! That’s it for today..
Thanks

"Jalebi Recipe - Perfect Recipe Crispy Out, Syrup Inside, Foolproof Instant - Traditional Indian Sweets Halwai Secret","http://cookingshooking.com/jalebi-recipe/","Hey Foodies,
If we do something like a Requested Recipe of the year, Jalebi would be for 2014  I’ve been experimenting all year to make the perfect jalebi, that is crispy from out filled with the syrup inside, does not get soggy, and is better than the market ones!

I’ve tried almost every way to make jalebi in the past year, be it the traditional style using yogurt, with curd and baking soda, With Only Baking Soda, Plain method without anything, using a portion of urad dal.. Instant ways as well, using yeast, using baking soda and powder, using baking soda and citric acid, using fruit salt, using urad dal which turns into a lil kind of imarti.. But no luck, Its not like I mean these methods aren’t good or any recipe is bad.. I’ve tried making these all ways, but the results were not as i expected them, maybe I had expected more than i should.. The basic problems in most ways is the jalebis are either soft. they turn soggy after keeping in syrup, turns limp, is chewy, jalebis dont take syrup in, is flat, is bread like, is yeasty and crunchy like hell as well!

So you must be thinking, what makes it perfect? What is the thing that makes it good? It is Hydro, also known as Rangkat or Rangkat Hydro. Upon researching, found it is Sodium Hydrosulfite / Sodium Dithionite. Which is a vat reducing / bleaching agent as a technical grade product.  But this is used in food industry as a preservative and also in sweets for which a food-grade is sold i believe. And In India, this is a common ingredient used by Halwais, but it is kept to themselves. Easily available in Wholesale Grocery Stores and Bakery Supply Stores. Chances are almost none that your nearby-retail store or supermarket would carry this. I also found this link while researching from where you can buy this, I am in no-way related to this website. If you are doing any transaction, please do it in your risk. I bought from my bakery supply store. And if you have made or are able to make jalebis, Hats off and Salute to you! Seriously, it isn’t easy to make and perfect these! So, Hats off and Salute! 

 
What is the role in the recipe? Just a pinch of this is very powerful in its work. What does it do? Well, we basically take a pinch of it, add to a cup of flour add water and make a thick batter. Then beat it, the agitation helps in incorporating air to the batter. Also while this turns from a very thick paste kind batter to a free-flowing smooth(kind of slang but “chikna”) batter. The consistency is difficult to explain, but have you seen a halwai making jalebis? The batter flows in a stream when he presses the batter, and stops the flow when he does.. This is what it does, the consistency is such it is flow(y) yet thick. A leavener is added to ensure they puff a tad bit and also get crispier. What it does it makes the batter super smooth, thick yet flowy and eliminates the step to ferment the batter. To make the jalebis, its important to have the smoothness, and the thick yet flowy consistency which this Hydro gives.

A few months earlier, I was talking to one vendor who has multiple stores, he said, “hum log to pehle wale batter me aur maida daal ke banate hain har roj.. and so on..” Translate: We make it by mixing more flour to the last day’s batter which works as a culture/starter.. Which runs like a chain from years to them, something like we make yogurt. I then asked whether if he can share some of his batter and the way he makes? He shared! I brought the batter and first saw the consistency, and there i was amazed to see thick yet flowy.. It was stringy as well, like if you put your finger in and pull it back string forms and was a little sticky and extremely smooth and chikna.. Then i made jalebis with it, they were awesome.. I was happy to make them, though i dint make the batter.. Then i made the batter the way he said, 1 kilo maida me 200g dahi mila ke thoro pani dal ke fet ke rakh do, jaise rat ko 10 baje banaya to kal 2 baje jalebi banagi. (mix 1kg flour, 200g yogurt and water as required. make a batter and beat. then keep for fermenting). I did the same way, but it din’t work. It wasn’t at all the way his batter looked and feel like and even taste like. Still i made jalebis and but they were not good.. Some were chewy and bread like and some were soft and limp..
He said, making jalebi is easy if you have a culture from last day.

The way he said to make these, dint work for me but the batter he gave me changed the way i was looking forward to make jalebis.. I was aiming to achieve the same batter, which led to this Hydro which makes this happen. And trust me, his batter did have this i can guarantee that. He din’t share that (why would he?)..
 

After thinking a lot and researching, I got to know about the magic ingredient and, after that I’ve been getting perfect jalebis everytime! They’re crisp, they are succulent, they are not extensively chewy, they don’t get soggy and best of all they’re way better than the market ones and not to forget this is an Instant Recipe YAY for that.. You can whip this up anytime you wish requires no yeast, no fruit salt, no fermentation  ! Let’s get into the recipe :t

I’m going to share one more recipe which results into good results in the most bottom, but the results are non-consistent at times and the jalebis are more delicate in this way like more of a crunch and melt in mouth like melting moments.

   Print  Jalebi Recipe - Perfect Recipe Crispy Out, Syrup Inside, Foolproof - Indian Sweets Halwai Secret           Ingredients  Maida / Plain Flour - 1 Cup / 130g Rangkat Hydro - a pinch [because, ek chutki rangkat ki kimat tum kya jano babu!] Baking Powder - ½ Tsp Oil / Ghee - To Fry [i prefer oil] Kesar Food Color - a couple pinches Sugar - 2 Cups / 400g Cream of tartar - ¼ tsp or a couple of lemon wedges Milk - 2 tbsp kesar and nuts - to top it the finished jalebis [optional]     Instructions  Start by making the syrup for this for which take a saucepan and add the 2 cups of sugar, about ¾ a cup of water and heat this up in medium flame. Stir occasionally until the syrup gets a roaring boil, and the sugar is all dissolved. If the syrup is dirty or cloudy, add the 2 tbsp of milk. Stir once and let it boil for 10-15 seconds in low flame. Using a skimmer, skim the dirt off the syrup. If necessary, you can strain it as well, but skimmer should just work well. Add kesar food color to the syrup, along with the cream of tartar or the lemon wedges. Cook for about one more minute in low-med flame. The syrup should be ready, to test add a drop of syrup in a bowl/plate and let it cool for a minute. Touch with your index finger, and then stick your index finger and thumb and then gently-slowy pull off the index finger. A small thread should form also the syrup would be sticky, the syrup is ready. If its forming a thick thread and more than one, add about 2-3 tbsp water to the syrup to get it back to a less than a single thread consistency. Switch off the flame and let it cool while we'll make the batter. Remove the lemon wedges after its warm. To make the batter, take about ⅓ cup of water and then add the rangkat hydro and then add the flour. Using hands, form this into a thick paste kind of batter. Add 2 more tbsp water if required be careful with the water amounts or else it would be very watery and flow-y. Once it is formed into a thick paste kind of batter, mix this in a rotating motion for about 5 minutes. This will turn from this thick paste kind to a batter that is thick, but flows like a liquid, and is exceptionally smooth and is kind of stringy if you touch your finger and pull back. This is what we want, this smoothness(aka chikna) and the flowy consistency while being thick. Also, all the agitation you did will bring a lot of air into the batter which is great! And you will see a lot of bubbles. One thing to note : This gets thick and stiff when you keep it idle even for 5 mins and a kind of skin forms in top, and then when you whip it again it gets back flowy. I've made jalebis in Ghee as well as in Oil, I'd recommend to make them in oil.. They are very heavy on stomach when made in ghee. And keep in mind this comes from me, a marwadi, who eats ghee parathas everyday! Heat up oil about ½-3/4 inch in a fry pan or a tai in medium flame. Add the ½ tsp baking powder to the batter, mix well and then transfer the batter to a disposable piping bag or a zip lock bag or a ketchup bottle or a lota/condensed milk tin which has a hole in center or a specially stitched jalebi cloth. Snip the bottom of the piping bag using a pair of scissors. Be sure to cut small, because you can't make it smaller if you make the hole bigger. Also it is not only the hole's diameter which determiners the thickness, the pressure of your hands plays a great role as well. Before making jalebis, make sure the syrup is warm neither hot nor cold. You need atleast 1½ to 2 inches of syrup in your pan so that the steam turns out and syrup goes in. We want to make sure the syrup is good enough for us to dunk the jalebis. Also the oil should not be hot. It should be low-med hot. Test by making a jalebi, if the jalebi moves with your hand while shaping its very hot, let it cool. It should be such that you can shape the jalebi then it starts sizzling and the bubbles start appearing. Make jalebis in the oil with patience, the shape comes with practice, look forward to have more patience. Cook the jalebis in medium flame till its well cooked, almost all bubbles are gone and it looks firm and is starting to golden and is slightly golden..Now's the tricky part, you need to be as fast as you can. Keep a tong in one hand and a skimmer in another. Using the tongs pick the jalebi and dunk it in using the skimmer inside the syrup for 10-20 seconds.Keep the jalebis inside using the skimmer.. Take the jalebis out using the skimmer and ENJOY THE FRESHEST AND THE BEST JALEBI, because there's nothing like eating one straight from the pan!  Make more jalebis, the same way and serve piping hot to you and your dear ones      Notes If you're still with me, let me give some tips: The batter can be made in any way, whether you sieve in the rangkat in flour or just add all the flour rangkat mix and then add water to make a thick paste. But make sure it is a thick paste and kind of gloopy. Then mix it as best as you can, while doing it you'd see the the batter kind of flowing more now. After mixing for about 5 minutes, you'll it is flowy, stringy, sticky and if you keep for a couple of seconds idle air bubbles will come up to the surface. It is not a strict recipe, i mean like baking recipes you can wet your hands and mix it if its way too thick or add a tsp of flour if its way too thin. Consistency should be such that it is flowy, but thick. Have you seen a halwai making these? How he presses the cloth and batter flows in a flowy stream, and when he stops it stops. 
I like to add baking powder, so the the jalebis puff a little in the oil and also get a little more crispy. You can use baking soda but, as it is more alkaline than baking powder jalebis will brown more. I like to have them slightly golden rather than brown spots. Both ways it should work well!
You can use 1 cup of jaggery and 1 cup of sugar for syrup if you wish to use jaggery.
Before starting to shape jalebis, try to play with the batter and the flame of oil. It should be such that the shape retains and you're able to make a good one. To try it and play with the heat. 
You need to be quick while taking the jalebis and dunking them in syrup, again be sure to dunk and not coat. Take the jalebis using a tong and dunk them in using a skimmer.

One more recipe, that i said would share here: Make sugar syrup using the ¾ cup sugar, ¼ cup water, food color and a pinch of cream of tartar/one lemon wedge as shown in video. Take 70 grams of maida, add 30 grams of urad flour(powder it in your mixer and sieve) and add in ¼ tsp each of citric acid and baking soda. Add sufficient amount of water to make a thick batter. Transfer the batter to a disposable piping bag or a ketchup bottle or zip lock bag, and pipe jalebis in ½"" oil as shown in video. Cook the jalebis in medium hot oil until golden, dunk in the syrup as shown. And take out in 5-6 seconds. Serve Hot. This way also makes good jalebis but i feel the consistency is not good and also they can get soggy. Most of the times they are soggy when taken out from syrup and then they turn crunchy after 3-4 minutes from out like melting moments cookies.. These are good, but i like the rangkat one better. I just shared this as well, because I know some people might not be able to find the rangkat and would ask for a recipe without it so shared  But trust me, You'll be able to find rangkat, in any wholesale grocery store.. Just go to your city's hyped wholesale market and ask for rangkat, or hydro or jalebi ka powder..:) Just try finding atleast 2-3 times, and not only in your regular grocery store, in the wholesale market or baking supply stores. I got it from Chawla Essence Mart, General Bazar in Hyderabad.   3.2.1311 





Now that you have the recipe in your hands, why not try it and enjoy the heavenly jalebis! Because, you know it Nothing is better than Jalebis straight from the Pan!!!!!

   Print  Banoffee Pie Recipe - No Bake Dessert Recipe | Valentines Day Dessert           Ingredients  Marie Biscuits : 120g Melted Butter - 6 Tbsp Bananas : 2 Condensed Milk - 1 Can (Dulce De Leche from scratch in Notes) Whipping Cream - ½ Cup Chocolate Shavings, Strawberries - as req.     Instructions  For Dulce De Leche : Add 3-4 cups of water to a pressure cooker, place the sealed can of condensed milk in. Close the pressure cooker and heat in high flame for 2 Whistles and then lower the flame to sim and cook for another 25-30 miniutes. Remove the cooker from heat and let it cool down on its own completely, once at room temp, open the cooker, take the can out. Use as required. (It is best to let the cool and rest for a couple of hours, i prefer to make a night earlier and let it sit overnight) Start by adding the biscuits to a plastic bag and get smashing using a rolling pin. It needs to be fine, but some crumbly bits are great! Transfer to a bowl.Pour in some butter, about 3 tbsp at first. Mix and keep adding more butter until it gets to a consistency where if you gather and press some of the mixture in your hand it forms that shape. Transfer the mixture to a 7"" Tart Pan and press down the mixture. Using a glass press even more, also make sure to press the sides using two fingers. Refrigerate for 10-15 minutes. Whip the cream using a whisk or a electric mixer until peaks form. Keep aside. Slice two bananas. Bring the tart pan out, make a layer of sliced bananas. Then scoop out the dulce-de-leche and make a layer of it. Dip a spoon in hot water and use if its difficult to spread. Almost all will go in, but don't worry, there will be some for you to indulge! Spread the whipped cream on top OR use a piping bag and pipe designs as you wish.. I went for some subtle stars using a star tip. Then, refrigerate for atleast 3 hours before serving. Before serving, curl up some chocolate using a peeler or a knife and add on top, cocoa powder can be dusted as well. I had some strawberries, so i sliced and decorated some of those as well. Slice, and Indulge in the heavenly dessert!     Notes For Making Dulce de leche from scratch which is extremely easy take 500 ml milk, 1 cup sugar and ¼ tsp baking soda. Mix all three and cook just like we make condensed milk. Cook a little longer until it is thick than condensed milk. Let it cool and use. The addition of baking soda at first will ensure the milk caramelizes.   3.2.1311 





Just a little time consuming, but the recipe is extremely easy.. So make sure you make this, for your self, for your loved ones and Indulge!!!!!
That’s all for today, Enjoy!"

The water which is collected can be used for anything else, like a Chana Achaar (Another pickle). Now, the mango pieces need to be sun-dried for about 2-3 hours. Use a cloth, place the cut pieces onto it and let it dry. After the mango pieces are dried, the weight shall be 900 g. It reduces while drying. Set it aside. Next, add the salt (90 g) in a big bowl and all the spices. Mix it and start adding the mustard oil, don't add all the oil at once, we need to make it like a paste so be slow and mix well. Add the dried mango pieces to the oil and spice mixture and start mixing, use your hands preferably. You can wear gloves if you wish to. After mixing, make sure each mango piece is quoted in the masala. And, your achaar is ready. Add it in a plastic/glass bowl and cover, let is sit for another 4-5 days without disturbing. After 4-5 days, a final sun bath would be given, for 2-3 hours, and it would be ready to relish!     Notes The mangoes you choose should be raw, and should not be yellowish.
Don't use steel utensils in any of the process of making the achaar. It can make the achaar rancid.
While sun-drying the mango pieces, use a cloth which you won't mind staining. Cause, the cloth might actually get stained.
The ratio of salt to ""dried mango pieces"" is 1:10, so if you have 900 g of dried mango pieces, salt would be 90 g. All the other spices measurements can be as per your preference.   3.2.1311

"Gulab Jamun Recipe | Traditional Desi Style","http://cookingshooking.com/gulab-jamun-recipe/","Hey Foodies,
Gulab Jamun is one such sweet dish I start craving for just when its name is called out for or just in a random food discussion. This warm and soft gulab jamun literally melts in mouth, and one forgets the count of how many they’ve had eaten. And, this is the best part, cause when we buy stuff from the sweet shop vendors we do love it but somewhere, we do feel it is not so great to eat a whole lot of gulab jamuns or any other sweet in abundance.

Simple ingredients and heavenly taste!
Heres the Mawa recipe: http://cookingshooking.in/mawa-khoya/

Chenna is here: http://cookingshooking.in/chenna-recipe-indian-food-basics/

   Print  Gulab Jamun Recipe | Traditional Desi Style    Recipe type: Dessert  Cuisine: Indian      Serves: 6     Ingredients  Sugar - 1½ Cup Water - 1½ Cup Rose Water - 2 tbsp. Saffron - Few Strands Cardamom - ¼ Tsp Khoya - 90 gm Chenna - 25 gm Maida - 1 tbsp. Baking Powder - 1 Pinch Saffron - few strands Pistachio - 1 tbsp Cardamom - 1 tsp Ghee - for frying Water - as needed     Instructions  For Sugar Syrup: Add 1 and half cups of water and 1 and half cups of sugar to a big pot. Mix it well, bring it to a roaring boil. Test by dropping one drop of syrup to a bowl of cold water. If the syrup mixes with water after sinking, its ready! We do not require any thread consistency. Keep aside and add some crushed cardamom pods and saffron strands to it. Knead chenna until well combined. Keep aside. Knead khoya until smooth and soft. Mix chenna and khoya. Knead for 2 minutes. Add maida and baking powder to the mixture and fold it all together for completely soft dough. If your dough seems a bit dry, add a tsp. of water/milk to it. Make filling for Gulab Jamun: one tsp. of cardamom, few strands of saffron, and 1 tbsp. of pistachio. All mixed together. Make 6 portions out of the mixture by stuffing a bit of the stuffing we prepared. Heat up ghee. Turn off the gas. Ghee should not be hot. It should just be warm. Slowly, add the balls and let them sink into the ghee. Once it rises, start stirring slowly, creating round turns into the pan so that the balls move and get the color and fried from all sides. Once, the Gulab Jamuns are of the color you had been searching for, transfer it to the warm enough sugar syrup. Top the bowl of soft gulab jamuns with some rose water. Let it be in syrup for 4-5 hours. I prefer to eat the next day! Serve hot by heating in a microwave or in a stove top. Garnish with pistachios and saffron strands.     Notes Sugar syrup should be warm enough while adding the fried balls.
Use homemade chenna and mawa for better results.
Baking powder is a finger dash.
Dough should be soft and smooth. Use Milk/Water to make it soft if its stiff.
For frying, I would suggest a saucepan as shown in video.
Make sure ghee has to be warm when balls are added. And you need to fry them in very low flame. Otherwise they will be raw from inside! It will take 8-15 mins to fry one batch.
Continuously stir the ghee to ensure great color. 
Soak gulab jamun in syrup for atleast 4 hours before serving. Taste great next day bdw!   3.2.1311

"Carrot Cake Recipe in Cooker | Eggless Baking Without Oven","http://cookingshooking.com/recipe/carrot-cake-recipe/","Hey Foodies,
Carrot Cake, a cake with grated carrots in it! 

But seriously, this cake is divine.. I’ve made it a lot of time in past and failed to make as well.. But now, It comes out perfect everytime and has a delectably amazing flavor of all spice along with the light & spongy texture..

This cake can be had just as a tea time cake, or can be frosted with cream cheese or any icing for that matter. But I like to just with some icing sugar on top.. You can bake this in a loaf pan, a bundt pan or any shape 

Believe me, carrot cake does sound boring at first.. But it is such a thing you get addicted to! It has happened with me and all of us in the family.. The light, soft & spongy texture is sooo goooodd!  So, let’s get on with the recipe, shall we?

        Instructions    
                
        
    
            
            
                
        
    
            
        Start by heating a cooker with - 2 cups of salt, over that place a wire stand and a perforated plate. Cover and let it preheat.    
                
            
        

            
        In a mixing bowl, add flour, powdered sugar, baking soda, baking powder, salt(a pinch), all spice powder, walnuts & whisk all well together.    
                
            
        

            
        In another bowl jug mix - yogurt & oil. Whisk together to combine.    
                
            
        

            
        Grease a 7"" cake tin with oil, or a bundt pan of the same size.    
                
            
        

            
        Pour the wet mixture, to the dry ingredients mix, also add the grated carrot and mix to combine all together. If the batter too thick, you can add a couple tbsp(s) of milk. It was good & dropping consistency for me.    
                
            
        

            
        Pour the batter in the cake tin, and place inside the cooker. Try to keep in center for an even bake. Keep the flame low-medium and bake for 20-22 minutes.    
                
            
        

            
        Check the cake with a skewer after 20 minutes by poking it in. If it comes out clean, its ready. If not, keep for some more time.    
                
            
        

            
        Take the cake out of the cooker, and let it cool. Then using a knife, loosen the edges, and take the cake out. Serve with a dusting of powdered sugar or frost it with some cream cheese frosting and Enjoy the amusingly light & spongy carrot cake with tea, coffee or just as it is!
    
                
            
        

    
        

    
        
    
                
        
            
        Recipe Notes    
                
        1. You can use upto 1 cup of grated carrots.

2. Nuts can be added upto 1/3 cup.

3. If you don't have all spice powder, you can also add some nutmeg & cinnamon powder or our very own garam masala.

4. I had a small 5.5"" bundt pan so i used a normal 7"" pan cause the bundt pan is too small to accommodate the cake batter. If you have a 7"" one or bigger, use that!

5. Time the cake takes to bake will completely depend upon the size of cake tin, shape and also the flame. I used a 7"" cake tin, and it was in low-med. Check the cake after 20 mins if you are using the same thing. In case of a 7"" bundt pan, it will take about 25 mins.

"Palak Paneer Recipe - Dhaba Style | Indian Main-Course","http://cookingshooking.com/palak-paneer-ds/","Hey Foodies,
What’s so great about winters? It’s Fresh Peas, Spinach, Sarson ka Saag, Strawberrys, and more.. So, recently on a trip, We were running out of time for the return so we hopped into a dhaba kind restaurant and quickly said Palak Paneer and naans.. My god, the hunger and how we(Me and Dad) finished the whole plate of Palak Paneer and Naans! And the taste was out-stannddiiinggg! And believe me, I had never liked palak paneer earlier..

So, as the winters were here, I thought to make some at home, Umm.. It was good but not like, then kept trying other ways.. Sometimes loads of garlic, sometimes extremely acidic, sometimes with some thickener, sometimes.. And went on, Unless i thought to avoid the blanching and make the gravy in one go like make the masala and add spinach and puree.. And breezee, it was awesome, and better than the dhaba   

Look, look at that! If you aren’t a fan of it, I would strongly suggest you to try this recipe.. So good, mouthwatering.. Wish there was a technology which would make food be able to taste from the screen..

   Print  Palak Paneer Recipe - Dhaba Style | Indian Main-Course           Ingredients  Palak / Spinach – 3 Bunches (chopped) Paneer – 225g Cream – 2 Tb. Onion – 1 (roughly chopped) Tomato – 1 (roughly chopped) Coriander – ¼ cup Ginger – ½” (grated) Nutmeg / Jaiphal – a pinch (grated) Garlic – 5-6 Cloves (chopped) Green Chili – 1 (chopped) Bayleaf - 2 Cumin Seeds – ½ tsp Yogurt – ¼ Cup Oil – 1 Tbsp Cumin Powder – ½ tsp Coriander Powder – ½ tsp Red Chili Powder – ½ tsp Turmeric – ¼ tsp or less Sugar – ¼ tsp or less Salt – to taste     Instructions  Start by heating up a pan, add a tablespoon of oil. To the hot oil, add the cumin seeds. Let them splutter, then add bayleaf, grated ginger, chopped garlic and green chili. Stir well. Once slightly cooked, add one roughly chopped onion and stir.. Add lil bit of salt and cook till it goes pink. Add the chopped tomatoes and cook till they are mushy. Switch off the flame and let the pan cool a little bit. Then add in the smooth yogurt and stir well for about a minute. Time for the spices – ¼ tsp turmeric, ½ tsp coriander powder, ½ tsp cumin powder, ½ tsp red chili powder and then grate in some nutmeg. Start the flame in low, and stir well and cook until starts getting a simmer. If the mixture seems dry 2-3 more tbsp. yogurt can be added. Add the sugar and mix well, then comes in the chopped spinach. Keep stirring and cook till the volume reduces, and the spinach is slightly wilted. After the volume is reduced, cook for another minute. Switch off the flame, add the coriander mix and make a paste out of it. Heat up a pan, add the paste and get it to a simmer.. Add more salt if required, also add the 2 tbsp cream. Mix well. Grate about 25-30 grams of paneer straight in the pan, and chop rest.. Mix well, and Serve Hot! Enjoy      Notes Notes:
Paste : Its upto you to make a thick, coarse paste with specks of spinach, and so on or make a silky smooth one.. I personally like the thick paste with specks which hand blender makes well 
Tips on the Green Color : Adding something acidic helps, like curd or lemon.. Curd is in the recipe which gives a good taste and helps. Do not Cover the pan at all, always cook in open pan.
I prefer to just chop the spinach and use.. If you wish, you can blanch the spinach, then chop and then add.. But I prefer this way. If blanching is your thing, you can add a pinch of baking soda in the water.. it will make sure its greener!
½ tsp Slightly Broiled and Hand Crushed Dry Kasoori Methi/Fenugreek can be added in the end.
If you wish, you can fry the paneer. Or add about ½ tsp oil in a pan, add the paneer and kind of shallow fry them then add the paste..
If you want strands of onions in the end result, you can chop 1 more onion into Half Moons and then kind of open them.. Then take ½ tsp oil in a pan and then add the onions cook for a minute then add the puree.. The place I had palak paneer had such onion strands.. Bothways taste amusing!   3.2.1311

   Print             Ingredients  To Soak - Almonds - 3 Tbsp Pistachio - 1 Tbsp Cashew - 1 Tbsp Poppy Seeds - 1 Tbsp Melon Seeds - 1 Tbsp Other: Sugar - 1½ Cup Gulkand/Rose Petal Preserve - 2 Tbsp Pepper - 1½ Tsp {Or less if you wish} Cardamom - 6 Rose Water - 1 Tsp Saffron - ½ Tsp {Soaked in 1 tbsp water for 30 mins}     Instructions  In a bowl, add the ingredients mentioned under ""To Soak"" followed by a cup of water and keep aside for 4 hours. Over night is best! Add the soaked mix to a blender along with pepper, cardamom, rose water, gulkand. Blend to a smooth paste. Heat a saucepan, add the sugar along with a cup of water. Once the sugar dissolves, add the saffron along with the paste. Stir well and cook for 15 minutes. I like my concentrate on the thin side, so i keep adding some water if it gets too thick. Once cooked for 15 mins, let it cool to room temp. For making thandai, take 1 cup of milk and about ¼ cup to ⅓ cup of this and give a whiz. Serve cold!     Notes If you make your concentrate thin like me, you would need to add less of it while making thandai. Totally upto you.   3.2.1311

"Paneer Tikka Masala - Restaurant Style Recipe / How to cook tikka in Charcoal at home.","http://cookingshooking.com/paneer-tikka-masala-rs/","Hey,
Paneer Tikka is one of the starters which we relish to the core whether its anytime in the day or year, and its bigger brother Paneer Tikka Masala is a dish we all order..

Why order from a restaurant, cause it has a subtle flavor and a distinct smokey aroma and taste.. All, that magic is in the charcoal..

You must have tried PTM someday or the other right? And the recipe called for either grill on a tawa or oven.. It must have came out good, but there was lack of something right? Its smoke/charcoal dear!!! And without the real cooking in charcoal, it can led to a butter-paneer style.. Which is good, but.. So, let’s get to the recipe 





Videofy yourself first 

Now textie?

   Print  Paneer Tikka Masala - Restaurant Style Recipe / How to cook tikka in Charcoal at home.           Ingredients  For Tikka : Paneer - 250g (Chopped in 2""x2"" and 2cm thickness) Diced Onions and Bell Peppers - 1 Cup Roasted Gram Flour / Sattu / Besan - 2 Tb Yogurt - ¼ Cup Salt - To Taste Chat Masala - ½ Tsp Lemon Juice - 1 Tsp Garam masala - 1½ Tsp Chopped Ginger - 1½ Tsp Chopped Garlic - 1½ Tsp Cumin Powder - 1½ Tsp Kashmiri Red Chili Powder - 2 Tsp {Or more} Pepper - ½ Tsp Canola Oil - 4 Tbsp Other :Charcoal - 2 Cups Wooden Skewers - 5 {Soaked in water for 30 mins) For Masala / Gravy - Boiled Tomato Puree - From 5 Medium sized Brown Onion Paste - From 3 Large Onions Canola Oil - 5 Tbsp Coriander - ¼ Cup Chilies - 3 {Slit} Salt - To Taste Lemon Juice - 1 Tsp Corn Flour - 1 Tsp (Dissolved in 1 tbsp water) Black Cardamom - 4 {Crush, opened} Coriander Powder - 1 Tsp Black pepper - ¼ Tsp Kashmiri Red Chili Powder - 1½ Tsp Ginger and Garlic - ½ Tsp Each (Minced) Fresh Cream - 1 Tsp Leftover Marinate - As much is left. Artificial Food Color - ⅛ Tsp {Optional} Sugar - ¼ Tsp {Optional}     Instructions  For Tikka : Into a mixing bowl, add all the dry spices and sattu. Mix well. Add yogurt, little at a time till you get a thick paste. Add in the ginger, garlic, lemon juice. In a small pan add 2 Tb canola oil. Once it starts smoking, switch off the flame and pour in the smoky oil to the marinate. Stir well. Throw in the onions, peppers and paneer. Get your hands in there and make sure it coats well. Cover with cling wrap and refrigerate for 30 mins(more is better). Heat up a gas tandoor/baati maker and place in the charcoal. Put the grill rack and cover lighly. Heat up for 15 mins in high flame. Skewer the marinated paneer and veggies in any order to the wooden skewer and keep in a plate for a moment. Once done, take the skewers and place this inside the tandoor on the grill rack. Cover and cook for 2-3 mins. To the leftover marinate, add 2 tbsp oil and brush this to the paneer tikka after 2-3 minutes of cooking. Cover and cook for another 3-4 minutes. Try to turn them over, being extremely careful as it can catch fire. Now cook for another 2-3 minutes uncovered. Take them out and keep aside. These are so delicious that you cannot stop yourself from eating them.. But, save some for the sabzi  For Masala / Gravy - In a wok, add the canola oil, Once hot add the black cardamoms, once it sizzles, add the ginger garlic and cook till the raw flavor is gone. Spoon out the brown onion paste and stir well. Cook for 2-3 minutes. Add salt to taste and pour in the boiled tomato paste. Cook till it starts leaving sides and oil, then add the kashmiri red chili powder, pepper powder, coriander powder. Cook for a minute or two. Add the red food color(optional), leftover marinate, sugar.. Stir well, and also add half of the corn flour mix, and stir well.. This will make the masala silky, if it does not, add the rest of it. Stir well and cook for a minute or two. Add a tsp of fresh cream, coriander, green chili, lemon juice, and stir well. Add the paneer tikka and stir gently, Pour in ¼ cup water if its very thick. Cover and cook for 2 minutes and serve HOT!     Notes Be extremely careful with the charcoal tandoor. It can catch little bit of fire at any time, so be careful. The effort is all worth, the result would be one of the bestest dish! 
Alternatively, you can grill the veggies in a tawa/grill tawa/grill modes on microwave/oven at the max temp. For the smokey flavor, you can add a drop of liquid smoke if you wish to. On the other way, you can place some active charcoal on a baking sheet on the lower rack and grill the tikka in middle rack. 
For the boiled tomato puree, I took 5 tomatoes, chopped then boiled in ¼ cup water for 5 minutes, and pureed.
For Brown Onion Paste, Slice, Fry and blend the onions with some water if it does not grind up.   3.2.1311 




I’m sure, you would go gaga over this, and would just go on licking fingers bowls and spoons  Pair this awesome sabzi with anything, Steam Rice, Roti, Paratha, Naan, anything!

"Brown Bread Recipe - Eggless, Healthy, NO OVEN | Eggless Baking Without Oven","http://cookingshooking.com/brownbreadebwo/","Hey Foodies,
Congratulations to all of us, 2 Years back, 23rd June was a normal day to us.. But I thought, I will Sign Up for a YT Channel and uploading or not would be decision made to be later, and hence CookingShooking was made.. Happy Annie to us!  Here’s the Red Velvet we relished 

Let’s get to the dish this post is made for.. Do you agree on, “We are Brown, and we eat Brown?”  Well, even whites love brown stuff.. Lol, lets stop being racist…

 
Here comes my Brown Bread, Its Healthy, Loaded with Wheat Flour and Oats unlike the 25:75 ratio-ed or molasses loaded storebought stuff..

I said, “Breads, if possible..” Yes, Its Possible to make Breads without a oven, let’s see how to make a bread without eggs, and without oven!






Textie, you are here for i see!

Please note this service is under maintenance, Service will be resumed soon 

		
   Print  Brown Bread Recipe - Eggless, Healthy, NO OVEN | Eggless Baking Without Oven           Ingredients  Whole Wheat Flour - 1 Cup / 140 Gms Oats - ½ Cup / 50 Gms Plain Flour/Maida - ½ Cup / 65 Gms Vital Wheat Gluten - ½ Tbsp Water - 200 Ml Instant Yeast - 1½ Tsp / 6 Gms Sugar - 1 Tbsp / 15 Gms Milk Powder - 2 Tbsp / 18 Gms Salt - 1 Tsp Butter - 3 Tsp / 15 Gms (Divided) Oil - 4 Tsp / 20 Ml (Divided) Milk - 1 Tbsp (For Brushing) Sesame Seeds, Oats for Sprinkling - 1 Tsp Each Other: Charcoal - 1 Cup     Instructions  Warm up the water, add the sugar and yeast. Mix and let it set for 10 mins. In a mixing bowl, add the whole wheat flour, oats, plain flour, milk powder, salt, vital wheat gluten and mix well. Add the frothy yeast mix to the flour mix and give it a good stir. Once clumped, transfer to your kitchen platform, add 2 tsp butter and 2 tsp oil. Knead this for 15 minutes. Add 1 tsp oil and give it a quick knead. Transfer to a greased bowl. cover with a damp cloth and let the yeast do its job for 45 minutes. Once doubled in volume, punch it down and knead for a minute. Roll it around to make a round even ball. Now slowly roll it with your hands to make a oblong log. Transfer to a oil greased loaf tin/bread tin and press down. Sprinkle little water and cover with a damp cloth and keep aside for 45 minutes. After 30 minutes, heat up a baati maker/gas tandoor. Add Charcoal below the rack, keep the rack and cover and let it heat up in high flame for 15 minutes. Let the air be out, keep the lid in such a way that the air passes out. After the dough has doubled, brush the bread loaf gently with milk and then sprinkle the oats and sesame. Place a tawa over the rack and line it with some foil paper to diffuse the heat. Place the loaf tin above it and cover the baati maker/tandoor. In low flame, bake for 15 minutes. After 15 minutes, let the bread sit on its one side. This is done to ensure the top gets evenly brown. Cover and bake for another 5 minutes. Switch off the flame and turn the loaf around so that the bread sits on its other side. Cover and keep for 5 minutes, Flame Switched Off! Take the bread out, brush the top generously with a tsp of butter. Let it sit for 5 minutes, then loosen the edges with a knife and take the bread out. Roll the bread in a damp cloth, Cover it completely and leave it to cool. Once its completely cool, take out and slice with a serrated knife or store in a bag.    3.2.1311 




Cannot get any cheesier! Try this, and impress people! 

Don’t have a gas tandoor/baati maker? Go and get one, why because its awesome! Ohk, let me explain a tit bit of the setup i was talking about in the video.
Basically, you keep a perforated plate over the flame(Heavy Duty one!) then comes the coal. Then keep a grill stand and above that the tawa. Then cover this with a big kadhai/pan which is actually very big and if using a kadhai, use the one which has no handles, something like this. It should cover everything. Yes, a bit confusing.. So, on my take, almost everyone has a gas tandoor or a microwave with convection, bake in that as this way is a bit confusing.. All the best! 
Believe me or not, this bread was so awesome that we ate two loaves in a day! YES! We’re not a bread fan, but there’s something awesome in homemade breads! Go and bake one a couple for you!

Mix well and keep to proof for 10 mins. In a large mixing bowl/kitchen platform take 2 cups of flour, add salt to taste. Along with the proofed yeast mixture. Get your hands in and form it into a dough, Add more water if required. Now add a tablespoon of oil and knead this for about 5 minutes. Place the dough in a greased bowl and let it proof for a hour or until doubled. Sprinkle some flour, and punch the dough. Knead it for a minute. Then form small portions out of it, about a lemon sized. Mix the garlic and coriander in a bowl for the topping. Heat up an iron tawa in high flame. Take a dumpling of the dough, and roll this using a rolling pin in an oblong shape. Sprinkle flour if necessary. Take about 1½ tsp to 2 tsp of garlic topping and spread on top. Using the rolling pin, roll once to press the garlic in the shaped naan. Pat once with floured hands, optional. Flip the naan on its back, and smear water in here. Just make sure to wet it, neither too much water nor less. Take the naan and stick to the hot pan on the water side. Let the naan cook for a couple seconds, then flip the tawa and cook it in the flame. The naan would be stuck to the tawa, and you'd be lifting and flipping the tawa to cook the naan in direct flame for even cooking and brown spots. Once cooked, using a spatula or ladle or some sort, take the naan out, and smear some butter.. Enjoy HOT!    3.2.1311

   Print  Eggless Ladi Pav Buns Recipe - Feather Soft /Dinner Rolls| Eggless Baking           Ingredients  Plain Flour / Maida - 2 Cups / 250 Gms Milk - ¾ Cup + 1½ Tbsp / 190 Ml Salt - 1 Tsp / 5 gms Butter - 4 Tsp / 20 gms Milk Powder - 1½ Tbsp / 15 Gms Instant Yeast - 2 Tsp / 8 gms Sugar - 1 Tbsp / 15 gms Milk & Butter - For Brushing Maida/Flour - for dusting Oil - for greasing     Instructions  Warm the milk, Add the sugar, yeast. Mix well and keep aside for 10 minutes. Add the maida, salt and milk powder in your kitchen platform mix well and make a well. After 10 minutes yeast mixture should look frothy(if it does not, then throw and restart or get another brand of yeast), Add this mix to the well and make a dough. It would be on the sticky paste side. Its absolutely perfect. Now add the butter to the sticky paste and start kneading. It will turn from sticky mass of dough to a dough that is a dough and turns to a bowl. I mean it turns to a dough, that's when the gluten is activated and it is ready will take 15 minutes of kneading for reaching that stage. Use scraper to scrape the dough that has stuck. And knead for 15 mins. DO NOT add any thing i mean do not add any flour or any oil or anything while kneading, all the magic happens just like that. It will be not soft if you add anything while kneading. After 15 mins of kneading, transfer this dough to a big bowl, cover and keep aside for 45 mins to one hour. It will double in volume after one hour, take some maida dust your hands and punch down the dough. Take out and knead for one minute, if it sticks too much, sprinkle some maida. Dont add too much maida otherwise the pav would not be that soft. Now divide this dough to 16 portions, about 30-31 grams each. Now keep one portion in your pan and with other hand roll this in circular motion to make a round shape. Take a 8"" square cake tin and grease with oil, place the shaped dough. Keep the dough portions very close touching each other. Otherwise they wont rise up, but rise sideways and become flat. Now cover the tin with damp cloth and keep aside for another 40-45 mins. Preheat your oven to 200C for 10 minutes. Carefully remove the damp cloth after 30 minutes so that they dont stick to the cloth. After 45 minutes, brush the pav gently with milk. Gently place the cake tin in the oven and bake for 15 minutes at 200 C. If the buns dont look brown, bake for some more time. Take them out immediately and brush the top part with butter. Keep aside till they cool and ENJOY!    3.2.1311 
 




Now, what are you waiting for, You’ve got the perfect recipe in hands, jump right onto your kitchen and let the pavs come out 
That’s it for today!

"Malai Paneer Tikka Recipe | Vegetarian Tandoori Recipes at Home","http://cookingshooking.com/recipe/malai-paneer-tikka/","Hey Foodies,

Cubes of Paneer pieces marinated gently in a mix of mild flavorful aromatic spices & cream then cooked over charcoal.. Resulting in an extremely soft & succulent paneer tikka with cubes of smoked & crunchy pepper & onions..

   Print  Malai Paneer Tikka Recipe | Vegetarian Tandoori Recipes at Home        Serves: 4     Ingredients  Malai / Heavy Cream – 3 tbsp Cream / Milk – 3 tbsp Cashewnut Powder – 2 tbsp Ginger garlic paste – ½ tsp Salt - as per taste Coriander leaves – 1 tbsp (chopped) Green Chili - 1 small (chopped) Kasoori Methi - ½ tsp Besan - 1 tsp Fennel Seeds - ½ tsp Cardamom Pods - 4-5 Black Pepper - ¼ tsp Paneer - 250g {diced, 16 pieces} Sugar - ¼ tsp Capsicums : 16 cubes Onion : 16 Shells     Instructions  For Marinate : In a mixing bowl, add in 3 tbsp of malai, 3 tbsp cream, 2 tbsp cashewnut powder. ½ tsp ginger garlic paste, salt as per taste, 1 tbsp chopped coriander, 1 small chopped green chili, ½ tsp kasoori methi and 1 tsp of roasted besan, ¼ tsp sugar. Mix the ingredients really well. Crush : ½ tso Fennel seeds, 4-5 cardamom pods and ¼ tsp black pepper in a mortar & pestle. Add the crushed spices to the marinate and mix well. Add the paneer pieces and marinate gently. Cover the bowl, and let it rest for an hour. While the paneer pieces are getting marinated in this wonderful combination of spices, you can light up the barbecue or tandoor.. Making the tikkas : After an hour, mix the paneer once again gently and then skewer the paneer pieces along with cubes of capsicums and onion shells in skewers, preferably metal skewers. I did - 4 pieces each of paneer, capsicums and onions in a skewer. In a hot charcoal lighted tandoor/bbq place the skewers and cook it in high heat, fanning the charcoals if the heat is low. Turn the tikkas every 10-15 seconds to ensure a even cooking. After the paneer starts getting golden spots, it all ready! Serve the tikkas hot with onions and green chutney..     Notes Malai : Malai is the thick skin/part that comes on top of the cream. We Indians, usually take that from the milk and keep it another bowl in the refrigerator. After we get sufficient amount of it, like a cup or two is collected then we make White Butter out of it, or Ghee. If you do not have malai, it is recommended to use heavy cream..
Cream : The 3 tbsp of cream is replaceable with 2 tbsp of milk.(Do not use skimmed/toned milk, use full fat milk).   3.2.1311 





Try it, Try it! I’m dead sure you’re going to love this super soft & succulent tikka.. That’s all for today, Thanks

"Cabbage Sambharo Recipe | Fafda Condiments | Gujarati Cuisine","http://cookingshooking.com/cabbage-sambharo/","Hie! Now, I bring delectable food every Wednesday and Saturday, Just for you!
Gujarati Food is everywhere, and we love it too, isn’t it? We adore fafdas and papaya sambharo.. I use to always think what was that yellow thing served with fafdas, its so delicious.. Finally came to know it is Raw Papaya Salad or Sambharo.. Then, my experiments and got the perfect result.. But raw papaya’s aren’t available all the time right? So, cabbage is the substitute.. Oh yes, Fafda is a fried snack made with besan or chickpea flour..

Cabbage. Yes, not everyone likes it.. But this preparation is sweet, sour, spicy, crunchy.. Its going to be adored for sure! I can eat this as it is, but this goes to next level when had with fafdas.. So, lets make..

   Print  Cabbage Sambharo - Gujju Food Condiments           Ingredients  Cabbage - 2 Cups {Chopped] Carrot - ½ Cup {Grated] Curry Leaves - 5-6 Gr Chili - 2-3 {Chopped] Turmeric - ½ Tsp Mustard - 1 Tsp Sugar - 1 Tsp Salt - To Taste Lemon Juice - 1 Tbsp {Appx.} Oil - 1½ Tbsp     Instructions  Heat up the oil, temper the mustard. Once crackles, add in the chili and curry leaves. Lower the flame to the lowest or switch off the flame. Proceed by adding the turmeric, cabbage, salt, sugar, lemon juice. Basically everything. Stir around nicely and serve!     Notes Do not cook this, If it cooks even a little bit. the cabbage will leave the moisture and will turn soggy/soft. We want the crunchiness from it.. I prefer to switch off the flame right after i add the cabbage..   3.2.1311

   Print  Mix Veg Manchurian - Indo Chinese Cuisine           Ingredients  For Mix Veg Balls: Mix vegetables (1/2 cup each of Cauliflower, Carrot, Cabbage and French Beans) Onions - ½ Cup Garlic - 1 Tsp Gr Chili - 1 Tsp Salt - To Taste Pepper - To Taste Corn Flour - 4-5 tBsp Plain Flour/Maida - 4-5 tBsp Oil - To Fry For Completing manchurian: Veggie Balls Onion - ¼ Cup (Sliced) Spring Onion Whites: ¼ Cup (Sliced) Spring Onion Greens - ½ Cup Vinegar - ½ Tsp [Optional] Salt - To Taste Pepper - To Taste Garlic - 1 Tsp Gr Chili - 1 Tsp Soy Sauce- 1 tBsp Red Chili Sauce - 1½ tBsp Gr Chili Sauce - 1½ tBsp Schezwan Sauce - 1½ tBsp Ketchup - 1 Tsp Oil - 2 Tbsp     Instructions  For Mix Veg Balls: Heat the oil for frying the veggie balls. In a bowl, mix all the rest ingredients very well and quickly make the balls out of it. Now fry them at med flame until half done/crust forms. Take the veg balls out of the oil and heat the oil to high. Now put in the balls again and fry till brown. Transfer to a tissue paper. Enjoy them as it is, they are delicious.. Or make a sauce, and enjoy as a manchurian. For completing manchurian: Heat a pan/wok with 2 tbsp oil in high flame. Throw in the garlic and chili. Saute for a couple of secs.. Add in the onions, spring onion whites. Stir well and cook for a few secs.. Add in a handful of spring onion greens, salt and pepper to taste, soy sauce, chili sauce, red chili sauce, schezwan sauce, ketchup, vinegar and about 2 tbsp of water. Now throw in the veggie balls and stir well. Garnish with spring onion greens and enjoy!     Notes Dont want to use all those sauces? Replace them with all in one sauce.
You can skip vinegar..
I like to add more schezwan sauce about 2-3 tbsp of it and about ½ tbsp of chili sauces... 
If you like a thick starchy sauce/gravy, go ahead with 1 tbsp corn flour diluted in ¼ cup water and add that before adding the veggie balls.   3.2.1311 




Make this and enjoyy

        Begin by taking a cup of flour, a tsp of salt, tablespoon worth of milk powder, ½ tsp yeast proofed in water with ½ tsp sugar. And a tsp of oil.     
                
            
        

            
        Mix the ingredients to form a clumpy mass. Take it down to the counter and knead into a soft dough using warm water if required. Place in a greased bowl for an hour to proof    
                
            
        

            
        Once doubled, divide the dough into two portions. Take a portion and roll it down tot about 6"", prick all over with a fork.

Take that out and repeat the process with another part of dough.    
                
            
        

            
        Spread schezwan chutney over the cooked pizza base, follow it up by a slice of cheese. Sprinkle in a good sum of masala-e-magic or curry powder.      
                
            
        

            
        Next goes in onions, peppers, corn, a dash of salt. Top it off with a few broken slices of cheese. Place it on the tawa to get baked in low flame, covered for 4-6 minutes.    
                
            
        

            
        Once the cheese is melted & the bottom is brown, take it off the pan and sprinkle a bit of the curry powder and slice it down to bite size chunks. Serve!

Now the final layer, keep it upside down and then spread syrup!Take a big dollop of stiff cream and then spread it on top as well on sides. Then make it smooth! If crumbs are seen, do a crumb coat! Keep the cake in freezer for 10 mins(optional). Makes easier to transfer to serving base! Transfer the cake to Cake base using palette knife. Be careful! Lace: Melt some chocolate over a bowl and then transfer to a piping bag. Cut a Butterpaper/Parchment Paper in the size of the cake's circumference. And then make some design in the sheet. Let it dry for 2 mins and then stick in the cake. Transfer the cake to the freezer for 5 mins and then peel the butterpaper. Now add the remaining cream to a piping bag fitted with a star nozzle. Make some shell design as shown in video. Decorate with pinepple slices or as you wish. Enjoy!!     Notes For Electric Oven: Bake at 180 C for 25-40mins!
The tin i used is a spring form tin of 17 cm diameter. I wanted some more height in my cake so i multiplied the sponge recipe by 1.5. That is increased the ingredients by 1.5. Like 1.5 cup maida and so on! 
Baking time: As i made a little bigger cake it took 40 mins to bake! 
Over baking can yield to a hard cake. So as soon as the toothpick comes out clean, switch it off and take it out!
I've made a lace of chocolate and applied for a different look in the simple looking cake. If you wish to skip it, you can ofcourse skip!   3.2.1311 
 




Here’s a slice for you!

Isn’t the recipe so easy? So what are you waiting for? Make this and enjoy! Oh

"Eggless Cupcakes Recipe In Microwave Convection Mode - Eggless Microwave Baking","http://cookingshooking.com/mw-cupcake/","Hey Foodies,
Baking a cake or a cupcake is easy, but if you have have Microwave with Convection Mode and the bakes does not come out as expected, this is for you.

In a normal Oven, there are heating rods in top as well as in the bottom which makes the food bake evenly. These days Microwaves come with Convection Mode which is meant for baking.. Convection is nothing but Fan-Forced Baking, which means there is a fan which circulates the air inside the oven. While this is normal in High-end-OTGs, Built in Ovens, Gas Ranges and so on, which makes the baking happen faster and even.

The scenario is somewhat different in this case, there is only one source of heat, the heating rods are either in top of the Microwave or in the sides.. Which makes the food cook faster from the top/side and slower from beneath, even with the convection/fan forced heating. Yes, this might not happen with each and every Microwave with Convection, but does happen with mine, one more i tested in, and many of you said as well. That the cake i baked in my oven was cooked from top well, but batter was wet inside. Then when i cooked it more, it was overcooked from top.

If you are successfully baking goodies in your MW then, its great! Please don’t follow the excess steps mentioned just follow the recipe if you wish to

   Print  Eggless Cupcakes Recipe In Microwave Convection Mode - Eggless Microwave Baking        Serves: 6 Cupcakes    EasyRecipe  Ingredients  Flour / Maida - 1 Cup Oil - ¼ Cup Sugar - ½ Cup Milk - ½ Cup Vinegar - 1½ Tsp Baking Soda - ¼ Tsp Baking Powder - ½ Tsp Vanilla Essence - 1 Tsp     Instructions  Start by preheating your Microwave Oven in Convection Mode for 10 Minutes at 170 C. Whisk flour,baking soda and baking powder together. In a separate bowl mix milk and vinegar together in another bowl and keep aside. Line a cupcake tray or individual cupcake moulds with Cupcake liners. If using Silicone Moulds no need to line. In a mixing bowl, add the oil,sugar, vanilla essence. Beat for a minute or so. Now add the milk and vinegar mixture. Give it a mix. Add the flour mixture, and mix it well. And finally use a spatula to fold and mix. Scoop the batter into cupcake liners. Open the the microwave and place a small wire stand or something that can elevate the height from touching the turning plate. Place the cupcake tray and close the oven, Bake for 15 minutes at 170 C. If your oven has its heating rods on top, that means you would have to cover the cupcakes with a sheet of aluminium foil after they are in for about 7-9 minutes to ensure the cupcakes are baked evenly, not overbaked from top and undercooked from beneath. Try and test with your oven, as every oven is different you may or may not need to do this. After the cupcakes are baked, test with a toothpick, if it comes out clean, they are ready other another 2-3 minutes.. Take the cupcakes out from the oven, if you still feel the tops are crisp, you can cover the cupcakes with a damp cloth or a normal cloth for 10 minutes. After the cupcakes are cooled, Dress them with any icing you wish. ENJOY!     Notes I used chocolate stabilized amul whipped cream in this. Watch my Microwave Chocolate Cake Recipe to see how to make it.   3.2.1311 





Baking is easy, if you understand your oven well.. Try to play around with it and see how it behaves, Some of my foodie friends successfully bake in their MW’s Convection Mode without doing anything.. After-all it all depends upon every oven, I received a few requests for it, some also said that cake is baked but undercooked from center and so on, so did this tutorial. If you are successfully baking, no need to do this

        Slit 5 hot dog buns in the center, and open up the slit for filling it. Fill the buns generously with the filling.

        Recipe Notes    
                
        You can avoid the baking as well if you want, to do so - use soft and fresh buns first of all, fill the buns with hot filling, and garnish with cheese, paprika and ketchup. Let it stay idle for 4-5 minutes, then serve.

"Puri Chaat - Easy Indian Snack Recipes | Diwali 2015 Recipes","http://cookingshooking.com/recipe/d2015_purichaat/","Hey Foodies,
Deepawali or Diwali, the brightest festival of the year is here and this time around, we’ve curated two recipes for you to stir up, serve & impress your guests!

The best part? Both of these recipes are damn easy to make and are as scrumptious to the palate.. Why delay? Let’s get started.
Puri Chaat, a distance cousin of Raj Kachori. Easier to make, easier to impress your guests. I mean literally who can say no to a chaat. I can’t. Ofcourse, I’m a chatora. 
A crisp puri with bubbling hot vatana, ice cold sweet yogurt, tangy tamarind chutney, zingy coriander chutney, spices, sev, onions is this.

"Eggless Choco Lava Cake in Microwave in 2 Minutes - Chocolate Fondant Cake","http://cookingshooking.com/choco-lava-mw/","Hey Foodies,
Choco Lava Cake or Chocolate Fondant Cake, warm liquid chocolate filled cake is enjoyed by every one from every age group..

Oodles of so called lava inside a cake, is a surprise inside kind of thing.. There are a lot of ways making these, right from half-baking a brownie(kind batter) to imitating the lava by inserting a small piece of chocolate inside.. But when both ways takes a quite amount of time and refrigeration, guess what? Here’s a super-easy method to make these in a Microwave in flat 2 minutes right from batter, to the platter! 

Inserting a piece of chocolate bar won’t melt well in a minute’s worth of time also chocolate needs more of agitation, now as you can’t agitate a cake whilst cooking so I came up with this method.. Making frozen chocolate ganache balls and filling the lava cakes with it.. Also this recipe does not need any flour, just a couple of oeros, some sugar and milk and a tiny bit of baking powder along with our frozen chocolate balls.. Let’s get started!

   Print  Eggless Choco Lava Cake in Microwave in 2 Minutes - Chocolate Fondant Cake           Ingredients  For One Lava Cake : Oreos - 3 Powdered Sugar - 1 Tsp Baking Powder - a pinch Milk - 2 Tbsp Chocolate filling - 1 ball Filling Ingredients(Makes 10 balls) - Dark Chocolate - 120g Water - 30ml     Instructions  Making the filling : Heat up 30ml of water along with 120g of chopped dark chocolate in a pan until completely melted stirring regularly. Once melted, transfer to a bowl, cover with cling wrap and let it sit in counter top for 4-5 hours. Overnight is better. Do Not Refrigerate, Just Let it sit in countertop. Then using a spoon scoop out anywhere between a tsp to a tablespoon worth of and roll into small round portions. I made 10 out of it, which means I can make 10 lava cakes from this filling. Freeze these balls until completely frozen, then transfer to a ziplock bag and keep frozen. Use whenever you wish. For making one lava cake, take 3 oreos, powdered sugar and baking powder in a mixer grinder/blender and grind to a powder. Add the milk and mix it to make a thick batter. Take a silicone cupcake liner and add a tablespoon of the batter. Then place a chocolate filling ball and add all the remaining batter over top of the filling. Microwave this for anywhere between 45 seconds to 1:10 minutes. Mine is a 800watt microwave and I do 50 seconds for extreme lava, and 1:00 for normal lava and cake. Personally i like both ways, microwave it your way. As soon as the time passes, take it out and flip over to a plate, sprinkle over a touch of powdered sugar and relish the joy! Oreo Goodness with the ever so awesome chocolate lava!     Notes If you plan to make a couple of these at a shot, it may take a tad longer to cook in the microwave just fyi  Maybe if it takes 55 seconds for 1 lava cake, it will take 1:05 for 2. The time will definitely vary, try and experiment, this is such that however it comes out, IT IS GOING TO BE HEAVENLY!  
Even if you don't like oreos, you will enjoy it! My mom isn't a big fan of oreos, but she loved them! Add a touch of vanilla essence if you wish    3.2.1311

Just a couple of ingredients and minutes, is all it takes! So, don’t think much, make the chocolate balls now so that you can enjoy these luscious mesmerizing delight which takes you to a direct trip to heaven! 

That’s all for today, do try this and enjoy!

In a mixing bowl, add the butter. Beat well. Add the sugar. Beaten it until light and fluffy. Once well creamed, add the condensed milk. Beat until light and thick. Using a sifter, sift the plain flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt, garam masala. Fold the dry ingredients in the wet ingredients. Add the ⅓ Cup of Pumpkin Puree. If the mixture feels very thick, add 2-3 tbsp of pumpkin puree. Fold that in! Take a bundt pan, grease it well with oil. Add the ⅛ Cup of Flour. Wobble the pan. The flour should coat the pan really well. Add the cake batter to this pan using a spoon. Tap it well. Transfer this bundt tin to the preheated cooker. Cook for 25 mins in low-med flame. Flame should be on the lower side. After 25 mins, check with a toothpick. If comes out clean, cake is ready.Take it out and let it cool. Once slightly cool, use a knife and loosen the sides of the cake and flip it over to a plate. For Filling: Take 20 grams of whipped cream, mix it with Melted White Chocolate 120 gms. (This step is optional, you can just fill whipped cream) Add this mixture to the hole in the cake. Spread it and add some nuts. Now fill the remaining area with some whipped cream. For Icing: Spread a thin layer of buttercream to the cake. Roll out orange fondant into a thin sheet dusting cornflour to prevent sticking. Once rolled, dust off the excess flour and transfer this fondant to the cake. Press down the fondant to ensure it sticks. Cut off the excess fondant using pizza cutter. Take a little amount of white fondant, shape it to the stem shape. Coat it with some dark chocolate. Keep it in freezer for 5 mins. Wet your hands in water and spread the water in the stem's bottom. Now stick this stem to the cake. For Carving: Use a carving knife and carve a Jack-O-Lantern! Or use choco-chips and make the JOL Face! Enjoy!     Notes I'm not good at creativity so i dint carve a JOL Face. You can ofcourse do that, the color inside is same as a pumpkin!
I keep the flame on the lower side. You could also bake this cake in a Preheated Oven at 180 Degree C for 25 mins!   3.2.1311 

Make this awesome cake in Fall Season or Halloween or anytime in the year! Enjoyyy!

   Print  Red Velvet Cake Recipe / Cooker Cake / Eggless Baking Without Oven           Ingredients  Sifted Dry Mix : (Plain Flour / Maida - 1½ Cups, Cocoa Powder - ½ Tbsp, Baking Powder - ¾ Tsp, Baking Soda - ½ Tsp) Oil - ⅓ Cup {Flavorless / I used Canola} MIlk - ¾ Cup Powdered Sugar - ½ Cup Condensed Milk - ¾ Cup Red Food Color - 1 Tsp (Powder / If using liquid adjust add upto 1½ Tsp) Vanilla Essence - 1 Tsp Salt - 2 Cups {For Baking} For Frosting : Butter - ⅓ Cup Powdered Sugar - 1½ Cups {or icing sugar} Cream Cheese : ½ Cup Whipping Cream - 2 Cups Vanilla Essence - 1 Tsp Other : Sugar Syrup - ¼ Cup (Mix 2 tb water and sugar)     Instructions  For Baking in cooker, add the 2 cups salt in your idli cooker / pressure cooker and place a wire stand and a perforated plate. Cover and remove whistle if using pressure cooker. Heat in medium flame. For Baking in oven ; simply preheat your oven to 180 C. In a mixing bowl, add the oil and sugar and whip until smooth. Pour in the condensed milk and whip till fluffy and it starts leaving sides. Add half of the milk and vanilla and stir well, now add half of the sifted flour mixture and stir well. Add the remaining flour mixture and whip. To the remaining milk, add the red food color and stir, and pour in the batter and give it a good mix. Pour the batter to a 7"" cake tin which is greased with butter and lined with butter paper. Tap once and place the cake tin in the cooker and cover quickly and then in medium-low flame bake for 35 -40 mins. You can also bake in a oven at 180 C for the same time. Test whether the cake is done after 35 mins with a toothpick if it comes out clean, its ready if not bake for another 3-4 mins. Once baked, take the cake out and let it come down to room temp, then freeze for 4 hours. For Frosting : In a mixing bowl, add the butter and beat till fluffy and then add a portion of powder sugar(we'll add sugar in 5 portions), whip till fluffy and creamy, then add the next portion and continue till all finishes. Make sure to scrape the sides in between. Whip for 5 minutes in high speed then add the cream cheese and vanilla essence then whip for another 3-4 minutes. Cream Cheese Frosting is ready, you can use it as it is or make it creamier and delicious-er by incorporating whipped cream to it. Whip 2 cups of whipping cream to stiff peaks, add half of it to the frosting and mix then add the remaining whipped cream and then whip the mixture till stiff. Whipped Cream Cheese Frosting is ready. Let's Assemble : Place a big plate over a couple of bowls or in a turntable place the cake and slice up the uneven top and then slice it horizontally into three layers and keep aside. Trim off brown edges if any. In the turn table, apply a little bit of cream and place the first layer of cake then smear the sugar syrup. Add a big dollop of frosting and spread. Place the second layer and repeat, then place the third layer upside down and smear syrup then take a dollop of cream in a offset spatula / any long knife / pallete knife and cover the sides of the assembled cake roughly then the top. Make sure the layer is thin, as its a crumb coat. Freeze the cake for 30 minutes, then make a good layer of the frosting in the cake as shown in the video. Powder trimmings of the cake and sprinkle over the cake. Using leftover frosting make rosettes by adding the frosting to a piping bag with star tip and then piping in circular motion. Refrigerate and enjoy.      Notes Sad to say but my cake was a wee bit over-baked, hence some extra browning in the sides and bottom.. :/ But was extremely soft and heavenly.. 
Feel free to use only the frosting or with whipped cream..   3.2.1311

"Sanna Pakoras Recipe - Crunchy Onion Fritters | Sindhi Snack Recipe","http://cookingshooking.com/recipe/sanna-pakoras/","Heya foodies,
What better than a hot cup of coffee with some crunchy onion pakoras on a cool breezy evening. We love our pakoras for sure. 
But, wait, these ones are bit different, I tell you. These super crunchy little pakoras are a delight! This recipe had been shared to me by a dear neighbour, who happens to be Sindhi. These sanna pakoras are called sanna, cause I understand sanna means small. There is no much difference in the making of these from the old style pakoras, but the double frying & lotsa coriander does the trick!
So, without further ado, here comes the recipe:

    Chopped Onions

    1 bunch

    Chopped Coriander

    2

    Chopped Green Chili

    

    salt as per taste

    1/2 tsp

    Cumin Seeds

    1/2 tsp

    Corainder Seedss

    1 tsp

    Red Chili Powder

    1 tsp

    Chili Flakes

    1/4 tsp

    baking soda

    1 1/2 cups

    Besan / Gram Flour

    

    Water as required

    

    oil for frying

    
        

    
                        
        
    Servings: 
    
                
            
        
    
                
        
            
        Instructions    
                
        
    
            
            
                
        
    
            
        In a mixing bowl, add the chopped onions, coriander, green chili followed by the salt and spices. Mix well and add the besan/gram flour and add water little by little to make a very thick batter. Once the batter is ready, add a spoonful of hot oil to it.    
                
            
        

            
        In medium hot oil, drop in the batter to make big sized pakoras. Shapes don't matter as these are going to be double fried. Once the balls turn slightly golden and cooked from inside, take them out and let them cool.    
                
            
        

            
        Once the big sized pakoras are cooled a little, break them into bite size pieces, one big pakoras can be made into 4-5 smaller pakoras aka sanna pakoras.     
                
            
        

            
        Heat up the oil in high this time and drop the sanna pakoras into it. Fry until they turn crispy and get dark brown colour. Relish with some green chutney or sweet and hot ketchup.

        You may also add in some more veggies to this, but this is the way I was served and this is the way my neighbor shared the recipe.. I've been making this since like 2 years(when I made Black Forest Cake in Oven, that's when she shared this with me) and every time this is a wonder!

        Roasting the Besan - In a Pan/Kadhai, add in 6 tbsp ghee along with the besan and in low-medium flame, stir continuously. Keep breaking the lumps of ghee & besan as you proceed to roast the besan.    
                
            
        

            
        After 10-12 minutes of slow roasting, It should start getting aromatic, just keep it stirring and roasting for another few minutes.. Keep breaking the lumps of ghee & besan and roast till it starts getting clumpy & shiny..    
                
            
        

            
        As it starts getting clumpy,shiny take it down to a plate and let it cool for 5 minutes.     
                
            
        

            
        Add in 2 tbsp of nut powder and the cardamom powder. And mix it with a spoon.    
                
            
        

            
        After that's done, now add the powdered sugar and get your hands in. Rub the sugar in the besan mixture and mix really well, like we rub fat into flour for making shortcrust dough.. Remember you have to do this while the besan is hot, so be careful!    
                
            
        

            
        After rubbing the sugar well, it should get crumbly. Add 1 tbsp of ghee, mix well. If you like more softer & moister laddos, add upto 1 more tbsp ghee now and mix well. If it gets way more soft than you want, you can add more powdered sugar. 
    
                
            
        

            
        Take a little portion out of the mixture and press in your hand, and start rolling to make a ladoo. Keep aside, sprinkle a little nut powder on top & serve.

        Laddos taste best after keeping them aside for 4-6 hours. Overnight is better..
Want to cut down on ghee? Add 4 tbsp while roasting besan.
Be careful with adding ghee after mixing the powdered sugar. If you like dry ladoos, you can actually skip the ghee then. But atleast add 1/2 tbsp, and maximum 2 tbsp.
Powdered sugar can be added upto 1 cup.

   Print  Eggless Dry Fruit Muffins Recipe in Pressure Cooker | Eggless Baking without Oven           Ingredients  Plain Flour / Maida - ¾ Cup Powdered Sugar - ½ Cup Oil - ¼ Cup Milk - ½ Cup Baking Soda - ½ Tsp Milk Powder - 2 Tbsp Vinegar - 1 Tsp Vanilla Essence - 1 Tsp Mix Dry Fruits - ½ Cup + 2-3 tbsp for topping Salt - 2 Cups + one pinch     Instructions  Start by heating up a pressure cooker in medium flame, add the 2 cups of salt and a wire stand and a perforated plate. Cover, remove the whistle and let it preheat for 10 minutes. Mix vinegar in the milk and keep aside. Sieve the dry ingredients - Flour, Baking Soda, Milk Powder, Powdered Sugar, a pinch of salt and keep aside. Mix the wet ingredients in another bowl - Oil, Vanilla Essence, Milk+Vinegar Mix and keep aside. Take about a tablespoon and half and add it to the mix dried fruits and coat the dry fruits well in the flour. Now pour the wet ingredients in the dry ingredients and whisk it well together, do not over mix! Now add the dry fruits and using a spatula fold it in. Line Paper Cups in Individual Muffin Tins and then scoop the batter in about ¾ way. Use an ice cream scoop its easier & consistent that way. Top the muffins with some dried fruits. Ready to bake! Open the cooker and place the muffin tins inside, do not over load 3-4 at once. Quickly close and turn the flame down to low-medium and let it bake for 15-18 minutes. Once done, test with a skewer, if it comes out clean its ready. Take it down to a cooling rack. Let them cool and Enjoy in Breakfast or anytime in the day!     Notes They can be served warm as well 
The muffins can be cooked for a little longer than 15 minutes, maybe about 18-20 minutes if a more brown color is desired on top like i did for 3 of them.. But they can get slightly firm.. I'm in no-way promoting over-baking just that if you wish to do.. Not much of a difference in texture but looks better.   3.2.1311 




 
Soft, Moist and loaded with plump and crisp dried fruits in every bite, Sure is a delight to have.. Can’t stop at one.. So make sure you try it out 
That’s all for today, Thanks"

"Bengali Sponge Rasgulla Recipe","http://cookingshooking.com/sponge-rasgulla-recipe/","Hey Foodies, Here, I am with the perfect recipe of Rasgulla for you!! This is ought to be my favorite Indian Sweets.. I’ve failed, over 30 times to prepare this, Sigh! Just for you all.. Finally, after 4 months from my first try.. Here, I have the perfect recipe for you all!!

I would suggest, watch the video and see the consistency of the chenna to get the perfect rasgullas.. If the chenna is over kneaded, it wont work, if its less kneaded, it wont workout! So, see and consistency and prepare this… The key to get a perfect rasgulla is lying on the moisture content and the kneading.. Many recipes mention to knead for so and so minutes.. But the time depends upon the quality of chenna.. As i mentioned in the video..





			
    To get this Recipe on WhatsApp please follow the below steps
Please note this service is under maintenance, Service will be resumed soon 

		
   Print  Bengali Sponge Rasgulla Recipe    Recipe type: Dessert  Cuisine: Indian         Ingredients  Milk* - 1 Liter Sugar - 2 Cups* Lemon - 2-3 Tbsp     Instructions  Heat milk, stirring occasionally. Mix lemon juice with 2 tbsp of water. Line a colander with muslin cloth/dupatta/cheese cloth. Once, the milk boils, switch off the flame. Wait for 30 seconds, add about ½ of the lemon mixture and stir well.. It should start curdling. Add a few more drops and stirring again. Once the milk is curdled and greenish whey is out. Pass it through the cheese cloth lined colander. Wash the chenna with some cold water. This will remove the lemon thing and will also help in making soft chenna. Gather the sides, and lightly squeeze the chenna. Dont apply much pressure. Lightly squeeze. After that, hang this for 30 mins in a kitchen tap or a cupboard. While the chenna is hanging, take a pot which is wide and is deep. The more the deeper and wider, the better! I took a cooker which is of 3.5l. Any pot works as i dint close the lid of it. Add 10-11* cups of water to the cooker and 2 cups* of sugar. Heat that up! Take the chenna out from the cheesecloth, it should be dry* but moist*. Start kneading this. Kneading time depends upon the quality of milk. I wont give a specific time, just knead until it gathers all together, no lumps and bumps are there. And some fat will start releasing, as soon as it starts releasing, stop there and make balls. Make smooth round balls of about 1"" diameter. You would need atleast 4"" of sugar syrup in the pot you are cooking and atleast 10"" of width. Calculation behind it is, the 1"" will expand into 2"", and you atleast need 2"" more for the rasgulla to swim in the syrup to ensure it is round. The more the height and width, its better! Now when the syrup is boiling, add the balls into it and cover it. Setup a timer of 15 mins! The water should be continuously vigorously boiling.. I keep the flame on the higher side! After 5 mins, open the lid once, and stir with utter care. Cover and do the same after 10 mins. As soon as the timer rings, transfer the rasgullas to a bowl with a good amount of syrup! Now the most patienctic thing, you'll need to wait for a 6-7 hours.. After 6-7 hours, it'll be soft, juicy, moist, spongy, it'll hold its shape and will be heavenly! Serve it cold!     Notes Milk - Use Full Cream Fresh Cow Milk for best results.. Most of my failed attempts are due to the milk.. It has to be Pure!
Sugar - Sugar quantity depends upon the pot size. The ratio of sugar water i prefer is 1:5. 
Chenna - It has to be dry but also should have a little amount of moisture. If the chenna is dry, rasgullas will be dry/will dilute with syrup. If it has much of moisture, rasgullas will be flat/dilute/crack.. 
Kneading - Follow this simple rule, knead until it starts leaving the fat/ghee! Once you feel the plate and your hands are getting greasy, make balls and cook!
Rasgulla Size - You can make them smaller or big, its up to you! Ideal size if 1 inch diameter when raw. It'll be double in size when cooked!
Sugar Syrup - You need atleast 4"" or more of deepness of sugar syrup in the pot you are using for making this to ensure they remain round while cooking. Pot's width should atleast be 10 inches. 
Sugar Syrup should be continuously boiling while they are cooking!
You can clean the sugar syrup if you want crystal clear sugar syrup. To do so, add 2 tablespoon of milk to boiling sugar syrup. Remove the scum which will float in just another 10 seconds. And then cook the rasgullas.
You can use any pot with a lid. Ideal size of pot for 8 rasgullas: 10 Inch Width 6-8 Inches Height! You can cook upto 10 rasgullas in this big cooker and this much syrup. But i make 8 or less to be on the safer side!
Sugar syrup can be used again to make this delicacies again. Sometimes i make these in batches when making more than 10!   3.2.1311 
 




I love it the next day, but my craving does not let it stay it for that long.. They get finished as soon as they are cooled.. Feel free to ask me any queries about this.. I have the solution of this rasgulla.. Whether its dry rasgulla, or flat, or the rasgulla broke into syrup, or they cracked, or they diluted into syrup or so..  And dont worry, even they go awry, we have solutions for them..And one can make something out or other from it.. Its easy to make, but its tricky! Try it and let me know the outcome!!

"Heart Cake Pops - Red Velvet | Valentines Day Special","http://cookingshooking.com/heart-cake-pops/","Hie Friends,
I shot a few recipes for Valentines day but, back
to back all of these could not process due to many issues..

But here, I have got Cake pops which are heart shaped
which is made using a mild chocolate cake (Red Colored). So, these are red velvet heart cake pops  Lets have a look at the simple recipe! The Red Cake’s recipe is in the notes section.

   Print  Heart Cake Pops - Red Velvet | Valentines Day Special           Ingredients  Red Velvet Cake - 5"" Square/Any Size [Recipe in Notes] Melted White Chocolate - 4-5 Tablespoon Melted Milk Chocolate - As required Skewers/Lollipop Sticks - 14     Instructions  Take the cake and crumble it. Now add in the 2-3 tablespoons of white chocolate to it and mix well. Add more chocolate if needed. We're looking for a dough kind of consistency. Take a little bit of mix and roll between hands, if it rolls well without breaking its ready otherwise add more chocolate for the same. Refrigerate the mix for 15 mins. Line a butter paper in a plate and place a small dumpling of the refrigerated mix and cut it using the heart cookie cutter. Now slowly, yet firmly take the heart out and keep aside. Refrigerate the hearts for 10-15 mins. Take a skewer and dip that in the melted chocolate and skewer that in the heart from bottom and keep the hearts upside down in a plate until they're set(probably 5 mins). Chocolate works as a glue for sticking the heart to the skewer so be generous there. Once they're set, dip the heart into the melted milk chocolate, covering the heart all around. Now tap your wrist from other hand while rotating the skewer so that the excess chocolate drips off from the heart evenly. Now use a cake pop stand or a styrofoam or a colander so that they can stand and set well. While the chocolate is not completely set, you can sprinkle in confetti sprinkles or desiccated coconut or heart sprinkles or whatever you like and make the skewer stand in a colander/styrofoam/cake pop stand. Once they are set, you can enjoy as they are or after chilling them      Notes Recipe for my 5"" red velvet cake:
1/2 cup flour
1/2cup sugar
1/4 cup buttermilk (1/4 cup milk + few drops lemon juice mixed and kept for 5 mins)
1/8 cup oil
1 tsp cocoa
1/4 tsp baking powder, baking soda
1/2 tbsp liquid red food color

Mix the wet and dry ingredients separately. Add in the wet to the dry in 2 alternations folding well and after everything is well mixed, transfer to a lined 5"" square cake pan and bake for 15-20 mins in 180 C or in a cooker which has 2 cups salt, a wire stand and has been preheated for 5 mins with the salt covered.   3.2.1311

In a mixing bowl, add all the rest ingredients and mix well add the yeast and water mix and make a dough if needed add more warm water. Knead the dough for 5-6 mins. Place the dough in a greased bowl and cover with a damp towel/cling warp and let it prove for a hour or until its doubled. For Spice Mix - Add all the ingredients in a mortar-pestle and pestle it down until well combined and grounded for about 10-12 mins. For making the breadsticks - After the dough has proved, take it out and place it in a corn meal dusted surface and knead for a minute or two. Roll the dough out to 26cm diameter in a corn meal dusted surface. Spread mayonnaise in one side of the dough(in a semi circle way), get some cheddar cheese in, followed by sweet corn kernels, jalapenos, a little of spice mix and mozzarella cheese. Apply water in the edges and fold over. Press down the edges. Something like a calzone it is so far. Transfer this to a tawa/pizza tray which is very well greased with butter. Make slits in the bread at 1 inch difference to make the slits but just make slowly and dont go to the bottom. Take butter and grease the bread with it. Sprinkle the spice mix over and a little of oregano. If you like more of bread structure, let it rest for 25-30 mins before baking. Otherwise bake it right away at 200 C in a preheated oven for 20-25 mins or until its well baked. Give your temptations a wait of 10 mins before slicing.. Slice and serve..     Notes I usually add the spice mix in the dough instead of adding the oregano, basil, thyme, chili flakes. Works both ways and taste awesome both ways.   3.2.1311

"Whipped Cream from Low Fat 25% Cream | Baking Basics","http://cookingshooking.com/whipped-cream-lf25/","Hie Friends,
I’ve received many questions, comments, emails regarding whipped cream.. Sourcing Whipping Cream or whipped cream in India is not that easy. But we do get a low fat cream, which is usually used for curries/cooking.. The cream being a low fat, is not easy to whip.. After a couple of tries, I’ve achieved the stiff peaks..

So let us start whipping up the low fat cream which is perfect for anything!

   Print  Whipped Cream from Low Fat 25% Cream | Baking Basics           Ingredients  Low Fat Cream(Amul Brand) - 1 Small Pack (200ml) Sugar - 2 Tbsp Ice Cubes     Instructions  Take the cream pack, and snip of the top of the pack and refrigerate it for minimum 4 hrs or overnight. Also keep the bowls and the beaters/whisks in freezer for minimum 30 mins. Now scoop out the thick part of the cream in a bowl.. The thick part will be settled up in the top.. Place the bowl in another bowl which has a few ice cubes. Start whipping the cream using a beater/hand whisk. After 5 mins(10-15 mins using hand whisk) the cream must have doubled in volume, add in the powder sugar. Start beating again and whip until its stiff. It'll take a lot of time but it'll whip. Use it straight away or refrigerate/freeze until ready to use.     Notes Just ensure you have not shake(d) the cream pack.
Make sure the ice bath is cold. The beaters, bowls, cream packs are chilled. 
If atmosphere is hot, try to move to a colder area to ensure the cream whips easily
If the cream is not getting whipped, it might need some more whipping! With hand whisk it takes a minimum of 25-30 mins.   3.2.1311 




Sounds fairly easy isn’t it? Its very easy.. Watch the video for more clarity in recipe.

In a mixing bowl, add the grated carrots, boiled and mashed potatoes, coriander, green chili, ginger garlic paste and mix well. Now add in the nutmeg, cinnamon, red chili powder, plain flour and custard powder and incorporate it well. Just before you're ready to shape and fry, add the salt in mix well and make long cylindrical type shapes of about 3 inches. Coat it in custard powder well, then roll it between your hands to make sure its coated well, dip in water and roll in bread crumbs. Roll it in your hands to make sure the bread crumbs stick. Once these are ready, deep fry till half way done in medium flame. Take them out once halfway cooked, and let them cool. Increase the flame to high and let the oil get hot well, and then add the bullets to the hot oil. Fry until crunchy and serve! ENJOY!     Notes You can also squeeze out the water from the carrots if you wish to, which might make this a lil bit dry, and skip the potatoes as well thats how it was where i had it.. I dont like to squeeze the nutritious juice of carrots. 
Make sure the potatoes are not over boiled and are refrigerated for quite a time after boiling. Best to boil in night and refrigerate till morning if you wish to pack this as a snack for your lil one in lunchbox.   3.2.1311

"Butter Paneer Masala | Dhaba Style Recipe","http://cookingshooking.com/bpm-dhaba-style/","Hey ya Foodies, Balle Balle ^_^
As you might know, BPM being my one of the firstest dishes and I love experimenting on it..

Well, I had a BPM from a dhaba which struck me to get onto cooking years back.. So a week back, I thought forget the restaurant style, lets do the karchi-tod cooking..!

   Print  Butter Paneer Masala | Dhaba Style Recipe           Ingredients  Tomatoes - 8 Paneer - 200 gm Coriander - 2 Tbsp {Chopped} Onions - 3 Butter - 3 Tbsp Black Cardamom - 2 Green Cardamom - 4 Bay Leaf - 2 Cumin Seeds - 1 Tsp Dry Red Chili - 2 Oil - 2 Tbsp Ginger Garlic Paste - 1½ Tb Salt - To Taste Kashmiri Red Chili Powder - 2 Tbsp Cumin Powder - 1 Tsp Garam Masala - 1 Tsp Kasoori Methi - 1 Tsp Cream - 3 Tbsp Green Chili - 2 (Slit) Papad - 1 Small     Instructions  Puree the tomatoes and mince the onions. In a pan, add the oil. Once hot, add the cumin seeds, dried red chilies, bay leaf, and open the cardamoms and add them and then add add ginger garlic paste as well. Let them sizzle. Add the butter, once it melts well add the minced onions and salt. Stir well and cook in medium flame until light golden. Then add in the tomato pulp. Stir and as it gets a roaring boil cover and cook for about 15 minutes or until it leaves the sides checking every 2-3 minutes to prevent burning. Add the cumin powder, red chili powder, garam masala and kasoori methi. Crush the kasoori methi in between your hands before adding. While the spices cook for a minute roast a papad, crush and keep aside. And, as the spices are cooked add the water depends. I added about 1 cup in total. Followed by chopped coriander and the cubed paneer and cream. Stir well and cook for about 5 minutes. I like my sabzi a wee bit on the thicker side, if you wish you can make it little thinner by adding more water. Add the slit chilies and the papad. Stir well and serve hot with tandoori rotis, naans, rice or just dig in with a spoon!     Notes Feel free to taste and adjust the taste. I usually add some honey on my restaurant style BPM. Here i go with sugar at times.   3.2.1311

   Print  Eggless Brownies Recipe | Easy, Eggless Baking Without Oven           Ingredients  Cocoa Powder - 6 Tbsp Dark Chocolate - ⅓ Cup {Chopped) Butter - ½ Cup Yogurt - ½ Cup Plain Flour - ½ Cup Powdered Sugar - 1 Cup Baking Powder - 1 Tsp Instant Coffee - ½ Tsp {Dissolved in 2 tsp water) Vanilla Essence - 1 Tsp Salt - 2 Cups [Only if using cooker/vessel to bake] For Glaze - Melted Dark Chocolate - 50 gms Melted White Chocolate - 75 Gms Chopped Hazelnuts - 3 Tbsp     Instructions  Take a big cooker or any huge vessel(which has a diameter of over 9"", and a good height) and add the 2 cups of salt, a wire stand and a perforated plate. Or simply use an gas tandoor. Dont add anything if using gas tandoor. Heat the tandoor/vessel/cooker in medium flame. In a mixing bowl, add the butter and sugar. Whip well to ensure its creamy and fluffy. Add the coffee and vanilla and half of the yogur, whisk for another minute. Add the half of the flour mix mix well. Add the rest of yogurt and flour mix(save a tsp of flour mix). Mix well. Sprinkle the saved 1 tsp of flour mix in the chopped chocolate. Add this to the batter and mix well with a spatula. Grease a 8"" Cake tin with butter, stick a butterpaper which is bigger than the tin and then butter it well then sprinkle 1 tsp of maida/plain flour to it. Add the batter to the cake tin and spread well with a spoon. Transfer this to the hot tandoor/cooker/vessel and bake for 30-35 mins in medium flame. The edges would be firm and the center would be little gooey, that's when take it out and let it cool to room temp. Lift the butter paper out and cut and enjoy if you wish to enjoy plain or pour the melted chocolate and swirl it around for the marbled effect. Also sprinkle hazelnuts/anynut for extra goodness! ENJOY!    3.2.1311

Stir occasionally and cook till golden then take down in a bowl. When the potatoes & carrots are done, add the beans & cauliflower to the pan and cook till golden transfer to the same bowl. Then add about ½ tbsp of more oil if needed, and add the paneer cubes & cook till golden. Take down these paneer cubes separately. Brown Onion Paste with Coconut : In another pan, add about a tablespoon of oil and the two chopped onions, Stir & cook till brown in medium flame. Add the ¼ cup of fresh coconut & cook for a minute. Let it cool down to room temperature and then blend to a paste. Preparing the sabzi : In a kadhai or wok heating up in medium flame, add in 2 tbsp of oil. After it gets hot, add : cumin seeds, asafoetida, curry leaves, slit green chili, dry red chili, bayleaf. Stir and cook for 3-4 seconds, then add in the ginger garlic paste & cook for half a minute. Now, add in the brown onion paste we made earlier & cook it until it starts leaving the sides of the pan & starts oozing out oil. Pour in the blended tomatoes, add salt as per taste & cook till it starts leaving the sides of the pan. Add the masalas to it : kashmiri red chili powder, black pepper, amchoor powder, garam masala & sambhar powder and a pinch of sugar.

Serve hot/     Notes The restaurant I had this sabzi served it with a garnish of kurkuri beans.. Basically a fritter similar to kurkuri bhindi. You may make that, out of the 4 attempts I made at home I made the kurkuri thing thrice,, But the recipe gets more complicated and takes longer time.. So to reduce the hassle, I skipped it the fourth time, and it was still great  If you are a person who likes eating chicken pieces in a dish with a hand, you would like the kurkuri thing in the dish.
Also in the dish at the restaurant, it was loaded with black cardamons & cloves.. I skipped 
You can add tamarind pulp instead of amchoor powder, I ran out of it that's why replaced with amchoor powder.   3.2.1311 





I hope you like this beautiful combination of flavors, now come-on try the dish & tantalize your tastebuds! That’s all for this week.. Thanks"

"Rasmalai | Raksha Bandhan Special","http://cookingshooking.com/rasmalai-raksha-bandhan-special/","Hie!
Rasmalai does not need any introduction.. Everyone loves Rasmalai..
I keep my rasmalai a bit different than others.. Small Rasgullas which directly goes to the mouth and automatically to the stomach.. Also, unlike flat rasgulla for rasmalai, this can be eaten as it is, no need to break!
I keep the rasgullas in the rabri for atleast 4 hours.. which makes the flavors of rabri infuse to the rasgulla.. They capture the color of rabri, also capture the taste, flavor of rabri.. But my family members, prefer to eat this after 12 hours.. Which itselfs make a huge difference!
Small, Soft, Spongy Rasgullas, Rich, Creamy, Kesariya Rabri.. A heaven on earth!
Also the two new flavors to rasmalai, cloves and fennel. Took it to next level!!!
Do try this, You’ll Love it!
 
Tip Time:
Selecting Milk: Make sure to use Pure Full Cream Cow Milk.. Cow Milk is the important for making Rasgullas. I have failed miserably more than 15 times making rasgullas because of milk(THIS IS TRUE). It was not good. Find a dairy near your city and ask them for pure cow milk.
While Making Chenna: Make sure to switch off the flame before adding the lemon juice/vinegar. Add the vinegar/lemon juice gradually, about in difference of 10 secs.. Excess lemon juice/vinegar will make it chewy/rubbery. Also, as soon as the milk separates, Strain it.
Taking out the Water from chenna: After straining the chenna, make sure you let it hang atleast for 30 minutes. 1 hour is even good. Make sure you squeeze water from chenna once in about 15 minutes. After about 40-60 minutes, dry the outer surface of chenna to avoid excess moisture! Excess moisture in chenna will make it get dissolved in syrup.
Kneading the chenna: All depends upon the quality of
milk, quality of chenna. If your chenna is like a soft, and has a very very little amount of moisture it will be done just 3-4 minutes.. People say 15-20 minutes because they might be using toned milk, which have a very least amount of fat, hence takes a little long time…
MAIN THING IN KNEADING IS TO ACHIEVE A SMOOTH DOUGH, We dont need a paste of chenna. just need until it starts leaving fat! Dont knead like it is your enemy.. Knead it with love and care.. Result will be perfect. Kneading is the key for a good rasgulla. ..
Sugar Syrup: For Rasgulla: 1 Cup Sugar = 3 Cups Water. For rasmalai: 1 Cup Sugar = 5 Cups Water. Just heat in high until it gets a boil. No need of a Single thread consistency or more.
Cooking the rasgulla: Small Rasgullas get cooked in just about 8-10 mins in medium heat(medium heat as in continuously boiling water). Test by adding one rasgulla to cold water, if sinks, its ready. Over cooking will make them hard!
For second batch: If you wish to cook more rasgullas or if you are doing two batches like me, Add about 5 tbsp and 1 cup of water to the remaining syrup and then wait until boils. Use again. But make sure the syrup is not thick. if it feels like its thick, add more water. We want the syrup to be very thin!
Let the rasgullas cool in room temp.
Rabri: Keep Rabri thin.. Rasgullas will soak rabri.. And it gets thick after 1 hour, add some milk to it. it will get fine. Dont worry on adding milk. Its normal, i added milk thrice  Make sure, the rabri is thin!
Keep Rasgulla balls in Rabri for atleast 4 hours before serving.
I like my Rasmalai with loads of small rasgullas, If you want rasmalai like we get in market with nominal amount rabri in it. Make rabri from 1.5 liter-2liter of milk!
Feel free to ask any queries!
Do try it and let us know the outcome.

   Print  Stuffed Buns Recipe | Surprise Inside Ladi Pav Bread Feather Soft Recipe | Eggless Baking           Ingredients  Plain Flour / Maida - 1 Cup / 125g Milk - ⅓ Cup + 1½ TBSP / 95 Ml Appx. Sugar - ½ Tbsp / 7.5g Instant Yeast - 1 Tsp / 4g Salt - ½ Tsp / 2.5g Milk Powder - 1 Tbsp / 9g Hudson Canola Oil - 1 Tbsp / 15ml More Flour for dusting. Sesame Seeds : As required Milk & Butter : For Brushing For the Stuffing : Onions : ½ Cup [Roughly Chopped] Carrots : ¼ Cup [Roughly Chopped] Peas : ¼ Cup [Roughly Chopped] Corn : ¼ Cup [Roughly Chopped] Potatoes : ¼ Cup [Roughly Chopped] French Beans : ¼ Cup [Roughly Chopped] Green Chili - 1 Tsp Garlic - ½ Tsp Kasoori Methi - 1 Tsp Cumin Seeds - ½ Tsp Hudson Canola Oil - Little Less than 1 Tbsp Cumin Powder - ½ Tsp Turmeric - ¼ Tsp Red Chili Powder - ½ Tsp Chat Masala - ½ Tsp Black pepper : ¼ Tsp Garam Masala - 1 Pinch Sugar : ½ Tsp Vinegar : Less than ¼ Tsp Salt - To Taste     Instructions  Start by proofing the yeast, to do so In a mixing bowl add the Warm Milk, followed by sugar. Mix really well, then add the Instant Yeast. Stir and keep aside for 10 mins in a warm spot like a turned off microwave or oven. Add the flour, salt, milk powder in your working platform. Mix and make a well. Once the yeast mixture froths and activates add the mixture in the center of the well and mix to make a sticky, soft, paste kind of dough. If your dough does not turn out to be a sticky, soft, paste kind of mass add more warm milk to make it so. Once the sticky mass of pasty dough is formed, add the Hudson Canola Oil and start kneading the dough. Knead this for 15 mins, by that time this pasty dough would form into a kind of ball of dough. Do Not add any flour or anything, just keep kneading for 15 mins.. Make sure to scrape the dough from the surface time to time. Once kneaded, transfer to a greased bowl, cover and let it proof for One Hour or until doubled in a warm spot like a turned off microwave or oven. For the Stuffing : In a pan, add the Hudson Canola Oil. Once hot, add the cumin seeds along with the kasoori methi. Add the chili, garlic, onions, potatoes, beans, corn, carrot, and peas. Toss it and cook for 2 minutes. Season it by adding the pepper, chat masala, red chili powder, garam masala, cumin powder. Stir and cook for 3-4 mins or until the veggies are about ¾ cooked. Once the veggies are done, switch off the flame and add the vinegar, sugar and the salt. Stir and keep aside. You can add some coriander leaves chopped as well. Once the dough is doubled in volume, take it down to your dusted working surface and knead it for a minute. Divide into 7 equal portions. Just like you fill momos or stuff parathas, stuff the dough portions with the filling. To do so, take a portion kind of start flattening the portion and make sure the edges are thinner than the center. Keep a good tablespoon or two of the filling, gather the edges and press to seal. Sprinkle some flour if it feels its extremely sticky, kind of roll it between your palms to make a round shape. Grease a 6"" Round Cake Tin/or a steel/aluminum container of such size with oil. Place the Stuffed Buns in there. Stuff all the dough portions like so and keep in the round cake tin. Brush these with some milk and sprinkle some sesame seeds. Cover and let the shaped buns proof for another hour or until doubled. Preheat your oven to 200 C. Once the stuffed buns have proofed, brush generously with milk gently. Place inside the oven and bake for 15 Minutes at 200 C. Take them out, brush with butter. And let them rest for a minimum of 15 mins. Loosen the edges, and take the buns out, ENJOY      Notes You can also make these a night before and pack as a lunch next morning 
Feel free to add more or less or any veggie that you wish for. You can skip the onion and garlic if you wish to 
Sometimes, the flour absorbs more moisture and sometimes less.. That is because of the protein level of the flour.. So, add the 95 milliliters of the milk at the first, if it forms into a pasty kind of dough, Great! Otherwise add more milk to make it pasty and sticky    3.2.1311 




Right out of the oven!
Look, Look at the filling.. Doesn’t it tempt you? Try it once and you’d be drooling over them! 
These are literally outstandingly amazing! Jog right in your kitchen, and make these which are literally like Chatpati Veggies Filled Cotton Balls 
That’s all for today, Thanks"
"Mawa/Khoya Recipe | Indian Cooking Basics","http://cookingshooking.com/mawa-khoya/","Hey Foodies,
Mawa or khoya is one such ingredient which is part of the most sweets in India and parts of Asia, and is also a need in every dish of the Mughlai cuisine.

   Print  Mawa/ Khoya Recipe | All Homemade    Recipe type: Indian Food Basics  Cuisine: Indian         Ingredients  Fresh Non-Homogenized Cow Milk - 500ml Ghee - ½ tsp     Instructions  Take a wide pan, preferably a non stick. Add the milk and let it boil in medium flame. Stir occasionally to prevent the burning of milk. Stirring also ensures that the malai/cream does not comes to the top and we get a perfect mawa. In about 20-30 mins, it'll get thick. Once the milk starts getting very thick and gets small bubbles, add the ghee and now continuously stir until it starts leaving sides. Once it leaves the sides, switch off the flame. Let it cool in the pan. And if you are not satisfied with the thickness of mawa after it cools, cook for another minute.     Notes For Stiff Mawa: Cook for another 3-4 mins after it leaves sides in lowest flame.
This recipe is of soft mawa/hariyali mawa.
The recipe i gave yields 85-100gm of hariyali/soft mawa.   3.2.1311 
 

Do try this, homemade things are always better.. Specially if you are in India, you know it.. people sell adulterated sweets and mawa in festive season.. Prepare these Basics at home and enjoyyyy..

Mix all ingredients making a dough kind of, if it is very sticky and has much moisture and not forming into dough, add more Roasted besan & Bread Crumbs. After it starts turning into dough kind of mixture, let it rest for 10-15 minutes minimum. Making & Cooking Seekh Kebabs Divide the kebab mixture into 6 portions. Grab one portion, start shaping into slight oblong shape. Now press it in a Skewer/Seekh. Dip your hands in water, and shape the seekh kebab in the skewer your your hands. Make sure the kebab mixture is nicely distributed over the seekh, thickness should be equal in all sides, otherwise it may fall while cooking. Approximate length of 1 seekh kebab - 5-6 inches. Make more kebabs like so. Cooking the kebabs In a Coal Lighted Barbecue/Mini Tandoor/Sigree we are going to cook it. Fan the coals well, now place the seekh kebabs in the barbecue/mini tandoor. Keep fanning it to ensure cooking in high heat. Turn the sides of the kebabs after a few seconds.

Serve it with raw onions, tomatoes, lemon wedges.. Enjoy      Notes Steaming Veggies : You can add the veggies to a utensil, cover it and place it inside a cooker with a stand and steam it like that if you wish to.

   Print  Puri for Pani Puri Recipe | Indian Street Food        Serves: 30-35 Puris     Ingredients  Maida/Plain Flour - ¼ Cup Suji/Semolina - ¼ Cup Baking Soda - 1 Pinch Salt - To Taste Oil - To Fry     Instructions  In a mixing bowl, add in the maida, suji, salt and baking soda. Mix and make a dough using sufficient water. Make a soft dough. Once the dough is ready, cover and let it rest for 30 mins. Heat oil to very high. Just before smoky point. Make 3 portions out of it and then roll it thin. Roll it thinner than a chapati but not much thin otherwise it wont puff! Cut it using a cookie cutter/glass. Now drop these in very hot oil. Lower the flame and fry until golden. See Notes** Take the puris out from the oil and put them in plate and let them cool and then enjoyyyyy!!     Notes For Frying: Make sure the oil is very hot. If its not hot enough it'll not get crisp and it'll be thicker and soft from one side and thinner from another. 
Main keys in making these puri's are the oil should be hot, puri should be rolled well.   3.2.1311

   Print  Eggless Fresh Fruit Cake / Fruit Pastry Recipe - Pressure Cooker Cake | Eggless Baking Without Oven           Ingredients  For Sponge Cake - Plain Flour / Maida - 1 Cup Butter - ¼ Cup Powdered Sugar - ¼ Cup Condensed Milk - ½ Cup Fresh Cream / Malai - ¼ Cup Baking Powder - 1 Tsp Custard Powder - 1 Tbsp Vanilla Essence - 1 Tsp Salt - 2 Cups (For Baking) For completing the gateau/pastry - Whipping Cream - 450 - 500ml Powdered Sugar - ¼ Cup Sugar Syrup - ¼ Cup (Mix equal amts of sugar & water) Fresh Fruits - As desired (I used kiwi, orange segments, pomegranate seeds, cherries, apples, pineapple) Strawberry Wafers/Sticks - As desired)     Instructions  For the sponge cake, start by heating up a pressure cooker with about 2 cups of salt making a thin layer of salt in the bottom of cooker. Then place a wire stand and a perforated plate. Cover and heat until ready with batter. In a mixing bowl, add the butter and sugar. Mix and beat until its creamy, then add the condensed milk and beat for 2-3 minutes. Add the ¼ cup cream/malai and mix for a minute. Using a sifter, sift in the flour, baking powder and custard powder in. Mix well, and transfer the batter into a butter greased 7"" cake tin. Spread the batter and place the cake tin inside the pressure cooker, cover, remove the whistle and bake in low-med flame and check after 25 mins with a toothpick. If comes out clean, its ready otherwise bake for another 3-10 mins depends upon how much batter was stuck. Take the cake out and let it cool for 10 mins, run a knife over the edges and take the cake out, let it cool to room temp over a wire rack or a plate. For completing the cake : Whip the 500ml whipping cream using a whisk or a machine until soft peaks form. Add the ¼ cup of powdered sugar and whip it to stiff peaks. Refrigerate until ready to use. After the cake has been cooled, keep it in a turn table or place a plate over a bowl and keep the cake on it. Trim the brown spots of the cake as well as remove the dark spots from the circumference. Level the cake from top as well using a serrated knife. Make three layers out of this cake using a long serrated knife. For making even layers, you can place toothpicks in the cake and mark how thick you want your layer and also have something you place your knife on to make a even layer. Keep aside. Take a little bit of the cream and apply a blob over your turn table and place the bottom most layer of your cake. Sprinkle some sugar syrup. Apply some cream over the cake using a long knife / spatula / palette knife. Place some fresh fruits and just apply a touch more cream then keep the second layer of cake and repeat. After placing the third layer, sprinkle syrup and cream. Spread the cream over the top of the cake and the sides as well as shown in the video using a long knife / spatula. Remove excess cream and freeze for 30 mins. Now for the final icing of the cake, apply cream as before by placing a huge dollop of it in top, spread it using a long knife and then take little cream at a time and cover the sides. Make the cream even and remove the excess as shown.. Decorate as you wish, I did mine using strawberry wafers and fresh fruits.. Refrigerate for atleast 4 hours before serving.. ENJOY!    3.2.1311

Do you know what, this just mellows in the mouth.. Totally blissful! The cake was finished in a shot, and we were looking if there’s more.. :/ Now whenever I will make this, would make two of them or a large one!  Do try and let me know how it goes for you..
That’s it for today,
Thanks!"

It would be great if you could tell me how to make atta pizza at home.. Finally, here it is.. And not only she but many of you have requested me this, so..

Instructions  In a bowl add the warm water, sugar and yeast. Mix well and keep aside for 10 minutes. Add the atta, salt, herbs in a bowl or a kneading plate and mix well. Pour in the yeast mix and knead to a sticky soft dough, if required add more warm water. Transfer to a oil greased bowl and cover with a damp cloth and keep aside in a warm place for about an hour. After one hour, heat a gas tandoor/cooker in med-high flame or a oven at 250 C for 10 minutes. Dust you hands with atta and knead the dough out for a minute. Then roll it dusting atta in between to prevent sticking as thin or as thick as you prefer. I roll it to 26 cm diameter. In a pizza pan or any bakeable tawa add one tbsp oil and then place the rolled pizza dough and adjust the shape if needed to. Place the tawa in the tandoor and bake the base for 2 minutes. Wheat crust pizzas have a tendency to have a raw after taste/smell if not cooked well. Take the base out and spread the sauce, scatter the cheese, onions, capsicums, corn. Season with salt and smear the edges with oil. Transfer this to the tandoor and bake for 10 minutes in med-high flame. Pizza is ready, rub the herbs and add those in as well, slice and enjoy!    3.2.1311

"Paneer Bhurji Recipe - Indian Veg Sabzis","http://cookingshooking.com/paneer-bhurji-recipe/","Hie,
There are times when suddenly milk curdles.. And we make paneer out of it.. Same happened with me, but when i was making condensed milk. Which meant it was heavily sweet. and hence much cant be done there!

After thinking a lot, thought why not make Paneer bhurji, with loads of veggies and chili. The veggies would give the slight
crunch, chili ofcourse would give the heat, paneer’s creaminess will be there ofcourse. All in all, the dish would be perfect!

And it was perfect with soft, soft phulkas.. Lets have a look at the recipe..

Pressure Cook the dals with some more water added about ½ cup, salt to taste and ½ tsp haldi for 4 whistles on high, then leave for 2 minutes in medium flame. Heat up ghee in a pan. Crush up ginger, garlic and chili using a mortar-pestle. Add the cumin seeds to the ghee, once sizzles add the bayleaf, dried red chili, hing, along with the crushed mixture. Saute for a moment, add the cardamom, crushed coriander seeds, chili flakes. cook for a minute. Add the onions, ¼ tsp salt and cook till brown. Once starts leaving fat and is brown, add the tomato puree, salt to taste and cook for 10-12 mins or until starts leaving sides and fat. Once done, add a handful of chopped coriander, cumin powder, garam masala, kashmiri red chili powder, coriander powder, amchoor and kasoori methi. Mix well and cook for another 2-3 mins.. Add the cooked dal, and cook for 3-4 mins.. Make sure the dal is not watery, It should be very thick. Add ½ cup water, mix well and cook for 5 mins.. Switch off the flame. Heat up a charcoal until fiery red. Place a small stainless steel bowl in the dal and make sure it stays and does not sink, put in the hot charcoal and pour in a few drops of ghee. Quickly cover the pan. This will bring the real dhaba/restaurant taste, the smoky taste. Let this be like for 10 mins. Take the bowl out, mix the dal and relish!     Notes You can also add in a tablespoon of overnight soaked rajma/kidney beans with the dals if you wish to.   3.2.1311"

   Print  Kiwi & Blueberry Ice Cream / Berrylicious Kiwi | Eggless Without Ice Cream Maker           Ingredients  Whipping Cream - 1 Cup Condensed Milk - ¾ Cup [try first with ½ cup] Milk - ¾ Cup Powdered Sugar - 2 tbsp Milk Powder - ¼ Cup Kiwi Crush - ½ Cup Dry Blueberries - ¼ Cup (Soaked for 2 hrs)     Instructions  Start by whipping the cream until stiff peaks. It's much more easier to whip with a machine in the summers.. Add Milk Powder and Powdered sugar, and give it a mix. Then add in the milk and mix. Pour in the kiwi crush & condensed milk, and ensure it is well mixed, then add in the soaked blueberries and finally give a mix & freeze for 3 hours. After 3 hours, mix the ice cream to make sure the blueberries are well distributed in the ice cream. Freeze for another 6-7 hours or overnight. Scoop & enjoy      Notes Condensed Milk ensures this ice cream is frozen to a soft kind of stage, with least amount of ice crystals. If your freezer isn't very powerful, I'd suggest to make the recipe with ½ cup condensed milk first. If it goes well, then you can try with ¾. Bothways tastes fantastic    3.2.1311 





 
One of the most interesting ice creams, why not try it & share how you liked it?

I used about ½ cup each crushed! Melted Chocolate - ¼ Cup     Instructions  Take the cookies and put them in plastic bag and smash them. Once they are quite like sand, put them in a bowl and pour in your melted butter. Quantity of melted butter depends upon the moisture of cookies. Start by adding 50 ml of butter(appx) and proceed further to reach a wet sand consistency by adding about a tbsp by tbsp of melted butter. Take a little but of mix and press hard with hand, if it packs and stays, you're good to go! Take a Spring form tin[SF] or a loose bottom 7"" Cake tin and add in your cookie+butter mix and press down hard using a flat bottom glass. Refrigerate the SF until we're ready with the cake mix. Soak the agar agar in ½ cup of room temp water for 10 mins. In a mixing bowl, add in your cream cheese and whip it up for a minute using hand mixer or a whisk/spoon. Now add in your sugar and mix for another minute. Once, the agar is soaked, cook it stirring regularly in low flame till it dissolves well and no traces of agar is seen. While you're cooking the agar, heat the condensed milk in another pan. Once the agar is dissolved, add it to the hot condensed milk and continue to cook for another 30 seconds. Add the hot condensed milk and agar mix to the whipped cream cheese mix and beat well for a minute and add in the lemon and vanilla and mix well.. Whip the cream to stiff peaks and fold the cream to the cream cheese mix. Divide the mix into 3 bowls. Add crushed oreo biscuits to one and mix well. Add Bourbon Biscuits and Cocoa to another and Hide&Seek and choco chips to the third one and mix well. Take the refrigerated SF Tin and transfer the oreo mix to it and level it well. Level the bourbon mix and hide&seek mix next.. Refrigerate the cake for a minimum of 4 hours. Dribble some melted chocolate or cut a slice first and dribble next! Enjoy!!    3.2.1311

   Print  Red Velvet Cupcakes with Cream Cheese Frosting - Pillowy Soft n Moist | Eggless Baking Without Oven           Ingredients  Flour / Maida - 1 Cup Cocoa Powder Condensed Milk - ½ Cup Milk - ½ Cup Oil & Butter - 2 tbsp each Sugar - ¼ cup Vinegar - 1 tsp Red food color - ½ tsp Baking Powder - 1 tsp Baking Soda - ½ tsp Vanilla Essence - 1 tsp Salt - 1½ Cups (for baking) For Frosting : Cream Cheese - ⅔ Cup Unsalted Butter - ¼ Cup Vanilla Essence - 1 tsp Powdered Sugar - 1½ Cups (Sifted twice, after measuring)     Instructions  Cupcakes : For Baking in Cooker : Preheat a cooker in low-med flame for 10 minutes with 1½ cups of salt, a wire rack and a perforated plate. For Baking in Oven : Preheat oven at 180 C for 10 minutes. For the batter : Start by adding the oil & butter to a mixing bowl, then add the sugar and whip it. Then pour in the condensed milk, and whip it for another minute or two. Then add in the vinegar, vanilla essence and ¼ cup of milk. Mix well. Sieve the flour, baking soda, baking powder, cocoa powder over this. Give it a mix, Then mix the red food color with the rest ¼ cup milk and add the milk to the batter. If the color isn't accurate for you, feel free to add some other to balance. In my case, it was raspberry red, I added a couple drops of lemon yellow food color to balance the red color. Line Cupcake tins with liners, Divide the batter into 8 cupcakes. For Baking in Cooker : Place the cupcakes in the cooker, in mine I could place 4. Then close and bake for 15 minutes in low-medium flame. Check after 15 minutes with a toothpick, if it comes out clean its ready if not, bake for another 2-3 minutes. You can bake the rest cupcakes after this batch is baked. For Baking in Oven : Place the cupcakes in the oven and bake for 15 minutes at 180 C. Check with toothpick. Take the cupcakes out and let them cool completely. For Frosting : In a bowl, add the cream cheese and butter. Beat it for a minute, then add vanilla essence and ⅓ of the powdered sugar and whip till incorporated. Then add another ⅓ and whip, and then the last addition & Whip the frosting for another 2-3 minutes. Cream cheese frosting is ready. Add the frosting to a piping bag, then pipe the frosting in the cupcakes. Sprinkle with confectionery or cake crumbs. Enjoy!     Notes Recipe makes 8 cupcakes. But you can sneak in and get about a tablespoon or tablespoon & half of batter from around the bowl, and bake it in tartlet mould lined with a mini size liner with the normal sized cupcakes. Then after all cupcakes cools down, you can make crumb that mini cupcake.. Rest all are extremely soft & moist making crumbs can be difficult, but that small one would be slight drier as we will be overbaking it, which would help to make crumbs for topping the cupcakes.   3.2.1311 





Treat yourself with these heavenly delights, make ’em now & enjoy these luscious red velvet cupcakes 
That’s all for today, Thanks!"

   Print  Eggless Banana Choco Chip Muffins in Cooker ~ Soft and Moist | Eggless Baking Without Oven           Ingredients  Flour / Maida – 1 Cup Sugar – ¾ Cup Oil – ⅓ Cup Banana – 1 Choco Chips – ¼ Cup Milk – ½ Cup Vinegar – 1 tsp Baking Soda – ½ Tsp Vanilla Essense - ½ tsp Walnuts - Few to top (Frozen) Salt - 1½ Cups to 2 Cups (For Baking in Cooker)     Instructions  Start by heating up a cooker in medium flame, add in the 1½ cups of salt, a wire stand and a perforated plate. Cover and let it preheat. For Baking in Oven : Preheat at 200 C for 10 minutes in Bake Mode. For making the batter, we're going to start by mixing the vinegar in the milk. keep this aside. In a mixing bowl, add in flour, powdered sugar, baking soda and mix it. Mash a banana using a fork, then measure it, we want ½ cup of mashed banana. Add the mashed bananas, vanilla essence and oil to the milk+vinegar mixture and mix it well. To the dry ingredients, add in the choco chips and mix. Then pour in the wet ingredients and mix it. No hardcore mixing required, just mix it slowly and gently until everything is mixed. Pour in the batter to Self Standing Muffins Liners till ¾ way. Top with walnuts(or choco chips) and place in the cooker and quickly cover. Bake in medium flame for 18-20 minutes. Check at 18 minutes with a toothpick, if its clean alright if not, bake for a couple mins more. Enjoy Warm!  For Baking in Oven, bake at 190 C for 18-20 mins. Enjoy Warm!      Notes Usual Difference Between Self Standing Muffin Liners - Normal Cupcake/Muffin Liners : 1:3. This recipe will make 4 Muffins in the Self Standing ones, 12 in the normal sized.
Browning in Cooker : The muffins can very well brown in the cooker, but the issue is the choco-chips/walnuts at the top can burn & smoke which can get awry. Don't worry, you can bake this in Medium-High flame for 20 minutes and you will get browned muffins. I have done that earlier in my trials, in my trials I used to top with choco chips and they would smoke, but it wont happen with walnuts. So feel free to bake in Med-High Flame for 20 minutes. 
Other reason I like light colored/golden ones - The brown/darker top ones have a slight firmer top and a slight not so moist inside..   3.2.1311 





Look, look at that melting chocolate  You’re going to miss a lot, I must say if you don’t try this, try it out now! 
That’s all for today, Thanks!"

Wash it twice and soak it for 2 hours. After two hours, add the urad dal and chana dal let it soak for 2 more hours. Grind it to make a coarse paste. Somewhat smooth, if you feel the batter in your index finger you should be able to feel grains rest it should be smooth. Cover and let it ferment for 4-5 hours in summers or 7-8 hours in winter. After its fermented, add salt to taste and mix really well. Also add more water for desired spreadable consistency. For Making Upma: In a pan add the oil and let it heat up. Once its hot add the mustard and once it crackles add the suji,water,salt and give it a stir. Once it gets a roaring boil. Switch off the flame and let it cool. For Making Dosa: Heat a seasoned iron tawa or a nonstick tawa. Once hot, spread some oil and wipe that off with a piece of wet cloth. Now add two ladle fulls of batter and spread that.

Once it is well spread-ed add the onions, squeeze a tomato slice,add some green chili, throw in some coriander and let it cook for a minute.You can add a cheese slice if you wish. Half fold or full fold the dosa and take it out using a spatula and serve piping hot and dont forget to throw in some thin coconut chutney over it.     Notes I've been experimenting with Karam Podi variations. Here's the latest one I had made. However, I'll update the recipe if i get even deliciouser podi! But this is amazing as well!

   Print  Blueberry n Rasgulla Cheesecake with Hazelnuts Recipe | #FusionDiwali           Ingredients  Biscuits - 120 Gms Melted Butter - 75ml (More or less) Cream Cheese - 200g Powdered Sugar - ⅓ Cup Whipping Cream - 300ml Condensed Milk - 200ml Agar Agar / China Grass - 10g Blueberries - 3 Tbs or more (I used Dried, hence soaked overnight in ½ cup water) Hazelnuts - 3 Tbs Mini Rasgullas - 25-30 or more     Instructions  Start by taking the biscuits and crush them until they resemble bread crumbs. Slowly pour in the melted butter and mix until it feels like wet sand. Transfer the biscuit and butter mix to a 9"" Spring Form Cake Tin and press down using a glass until its flat and smooth. Refrigerate. Soak the agar agar in ⅓ cup of water for 15 minutes. Whip the whipping cream until stiff peaks. In a mixing bowl, add the cream cheese and powder sugar. Whip it well until creamy and smooth. Take a pan and heat it up in low flame, add the soaked agar agar and cook it until it is well dissolved and no traces are seen. Warm the condensed milk in a pan, Once the agar is dissolved, add the agar mix to the hot condensed milk. Stir well and cook for 2 mins. Let it cool down a little bit. Once the condensed milk+agar mix is hot but not boiling, pour it over the cream cheese mix and whisk well. You can sieve the condensed milk mix into the cream cheese mix rather than just pouring, but its optional. Add the berries and hazelnuts and mix well. You can also add a little bit of the soaked berry water for more flavor and color. Now add the whipped cream and rasgullas. Fold it well, do not mix it vigorously. Add the cheesecake mix to the cake tin and spread it well. Refrigerate overnight or for 10-12 hours and serve. For Serving, Run a small knife over the edge of the cake tin to seperate the cake from the tin. And open the tin. Decorate as you wish and enjoy!     Notes I decorated the cake with soaked berries, whipped cream, rasgullas, hazelnuts, blueberry syrup and a sprig of mint. For the blueberry syrup, i did a cheat by add 2 tsp of sugar to the blueberry water(the one we had soaked berries in) and reduced it by cooking till it was thick and used it after it cooled.   3.2.1311

   Print  Kele ke Chips | Raw Banana Chips for Navratri | Vrat ka Khana    Recipe type: Savory Snacks  Cuisine: Indian      Serves: 4     Ingredients  Raw Banana - 4 Senda Namak - 1 Tsp / Normal Salt - 1 Tsp Black pepper powder - To Taste Turmeric - ½ tsp {Optional} Oil/Ghee for frying     Instructions  Wash and peel the raw bananas. Dunk them in some water. Slice them in bowl of water which has turmeric and salt. Heat up oil/ghee. Use ghee for aromatic flavors. Fry them in low flame for crispy and light texture. Strain when slightly golden and sprinkle sendha namak and black pepper powder.     Notes Make sure you fry them in medium-low flame, frying them in hot oil would cause them to go soggy after they come in room temperature.
Strain them when they are golden or else they will burn. The colour is anyway going to enhance once they get into room temperature   3.2.1311

You can add less sesame and more tamarind to suit your taste buds. Stuff about ½ tsp or less of the stuffing into the chilies. In a mixing Bowl, mix the besan, salt, baking powder, turmeric. Add water and make a thick batter. Batter should be thick otherwise it wont coat well! Dip the chilies into the batter. Coat really well and slide them to the hot oil. Once chilies are added to hot oil, lower the flame and cook until golden brown! Serve Hot!!     Notes Dont keep the chili in hot water for any longer. That'll make the stalk soft!
You can use any pepper. Jalapeno, Hungarian Wax, Bhavnagri Mirch or any variant you have. Just ensure that its not too hot!

Notes I added about 6 tbsp of Nutella.   3.2.1311

   Print  Choco Bar Recipe - Beat the Heat | Without Ice Cream Maker - Easy, Eggless           Ingredients  Whipping Cream - 1 Cup Vanilla Essence - 2 Tsp Milk Chocolate - ⅓ Cup Powdered Sugar - ¼ Cup Milk - 1 and ¾ Cup Milk Powder - ⅓ Cup     Instructions  In a bowl add the whipping cream and whip it to semi stiff peaks. Add the sugar and whip it till stiff peaks. Add the vanilla and milk powder. Mix well and add the milk. Fold well. Pop it in the freezer for about 3-4 hours. In a bowl, add the milk chocolate and place it over simmering water in a saucepan and melt the chocolate. Take a popsicle mould or a bar chocolate mould and coat the insides of the mould with chocolate. You can use a spoon or a piping bag. Piping bag works better. Remove any excessive chocolate and pop it in the freezer for 3-4 mins or until the chocolate is set and is chilled. Spoon the semi frozen ice cream and put in the stick. Pop again in the freezer and let it be in there for 3-4 hours. When ready to serve, dip the mould in room temp water for 10 seconds and shake the water. Now turn it around and try to take one bar out slowly shaking the handle. Enjoyyyy!     Notes I used a mix of Dark and Milk Chocolate. 
You can add some peanuts to the chocolate and the coat the mould for a nutty bar    3.2.1311
