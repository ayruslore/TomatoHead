Misal has a mixture of sprouts where as Thalipeeth has a complex mixture of multiple grains and legumes. Thalipeeth Bhajni is generally available in the Maharashtrian pantries to make impromptu Thalipeeth. Served with homemade white butter (LoNi) and tea, it is really a gastronomic delight. Most of the vegetables can be dipped in chickpea batter to make delicious bhujis but most common and beloved are â€œKaanda Bhujiâ€ or onion pakodas which are especially loved during the monsoons. Due to their crooked shapes resembling crabs, they go by a quaint name of â€œKhekda (crabs) Bhujiâ€ though it does not have any crabmeat!"

I grew up eating a variety of mango pickles, a few were instant pickles, prepared with mangoes which had fallen off the trees in our backyard. If there were half a dozen such fallen mangoes, my mother would prepare two or three varieties of instant pickles. One such pickle is Mamidi turumu pachadi (also known as Pulihora avakai), made from grated mango, chilli powder, methi and seasoning of spices. The other instant pickle is Mamidi mukkala pachadi made from finely chopped pieces of mango, chilli powder and mustard powder. Both need to be refrigerated and can stored for atleast 2-3 minutes"

From the bridal finery, venue, decorations, guest list to the food, everything is meticulously planned and executed. Wedding ceremonies are elaborate with a Roce ceremony (pre-wedding function on the previous day (or one/two days)) preceding the wedding day and the Porthapon (grand dinner for close family members of the bride & groom) a day or two after the wedding. There are separate menus for each occasion and below is a traditional curry made of ash pumpkin that is served on the day of the Roce ceremony. Called as the ‘Pollu’ or ‘Polov‘, decades ago it used to be served without mutton/goat meat added to it. Today it is served as a non vegetarian curry along with a large plain bun and red nutritious boiled rice. Traditionally the meal that was lovingly prepared by close family and neighbours was served on a ‘shirothi’ (banana leaf). Today caterers handle bigger crowds and maintain a buffet system of serving the food which includes the polov, pork bafat or sorpotel and plantain (raw banana) sukka among others."

																						 Heat oil in a kadai, add the mustard seeds and as they begin to pop add cumin seeds, garlic cloves, red chillis and curry leaves and toast them for a half a minute. (Take care not to burn the tempering).

				
																							 Add chickpea flour and salt and roast along with the tempering base. On low to medium flame, constantly keep frying the besan till it changes colour (and lovely aroma emanates and the rawness of chickpea flour disappears). This could take some time, approx 8-9 mts. Take care not to burn the senaga pindi. Turn off heat. Remove onto a plate and cool.

				
																							 Once cool, add the tamarind extract along with water and combine well. It should be of a slightly runny consistency. Add more water if required. For a more tangy flavor, add more tamarind extract.

				
																							Use your hand to bring them all together and also crush the tempering base as you combine. The flavors of spices come out well as you crush them. Adjust salt.

One of the key ingredients is grated coconut and it has to be fresh and moist and hand pounding enables the juice and oil components of the freshly grated coconut to ooze out, helping all the ingredients hold together and even brings out even the subtle flavours that cannot be achieved with an electric grinder. Since it is one of those snacks embossed with the homemade element, I have seen many families serving this snack for guests visiting on the previous days of marriage. If you are a lucky traveler visiting Kerala, you may find them stacked in glass jars at small roadside shops, Pettikkada as most of the time women of the house prepare these humble snacks with inexpensive and readily available ingredients at home and the next day men folks take it to shop for selling."

The Latin name of Ragi is Elusine Indica which is a traditional crop of S.India and is also known as the poor manâ€™s millet due to its long sustenance.The labouring farmers in our villages sustain on this whole grain which is more superior to rice or wheat in nutritional terms, being rich in proteins,providing highest levels of calcium,antioxidants properties, phytochemicals and high levels of dietary fibre which makes it easily and slowly digestable(hence helps control blood glucose levels in diabetics very effectively).The bulkiness of the fiber and the slower digestion rate makes us feel fuller on fewer calories, and therefore may help prevent us from eating excess calories.I have read this interesting article on fat loss with this wonder grain here ,where the author shows how we can manage to prevent obesity by incorporating ragi in our diet."

Heat 1/2 tbsp oil in a pan and add the garlic cloves and onions and fry on medium heat for 7-8 minutes or till transparent. Remove from fire and cool. Grind to a paste adding little water.

Add the coriander pwd, cumin pwd, chilli pwd, butter or ghee, sugar or jaggery and salt. Mix well.

Now take each brinjal and cut from the base end (opposite side of stem)  and make a slit towards stem side but not all the way through i.e slit each brinjal into four sections lengthwise without cutting off the crown. The brinjals are ready for stuffing and the stuffing requires some patience…:)

Separate the brinjal quarters gently and fill the stuffing inside slowly without breaking the brinjals.

Stuff all the brinjals in this manner. Keep aside the remaining paste."

Mix the grated coconut and cumin powder together. Alternately you could pulse the chilies and cumin seeds and shredded coconut to a coarse mixture without adding any water.

Heat oil in a pan and allow mustard seeds to splutter. Reduce heat and add in the lentils and curry leaves. Then add the sliced onion and green chilies and saute for a minute. Now reduce heat and add the turmeric and cabbage into the pan and mix well. Make a well in the middle of the cabbage and add the coconut mixture and cover it with the cabbage. Maintain medium heat, add 1 tsp water, (again optional because too much of water will always spoil the dish. So be careful with the water) and cover the pan. Let it cook for about 5 minutes and then give it a stir. Check to see if it is cooked. It’s done when there is still a bite left to it..kind of like al dente.:) Be careful with the heat setting. Too high, it will get burnt.. too low, it will leave too much moisture. If there is excess moisture, stir on high heat for a minute. When it is almost done, take it off the flame and leave covered for 5 minutes."

										  The milk should be luke warm or slightly more than luke warm. It should not be cold or at room temperature.

										  Do NOT over mix the flour into the wet ingredients. Just lightly fold the flour till you find no trace of flour.

										  The consistency of the cake batter is like a thick dosa/idli batter.

										  Oven temperatures differ from oven to oven. My oven took almost 20 mts to bake the cupcakes. Check from 15 mts onwards.

										  Place the pan in the middle rack of the oven and bake.

										  This batter makes 18 cupcakes (standard size)."

									  1.Wash your hands immediately on chopping them as it stains and tends to be sticky.

										  2.Nip off the top and tail part of the ivy gourd before chopping / stuffing /cooking them.

										  3.Use only the tender green color ivy gourds where the seeds are tender and not very mature, the very mature ivy gourds, though appear green on the outside, have a bright red color on the inside and are very sour and are best discarded.

										  4.Its best to serve them immediately on cooking as it has a crunchy texture and nice color which might not be the case if made ahead and served after a few hours of cooking, especially with stir-fries and stuffed curries. The taste is the same though, whether served immediately on cooking or after a couple of hours of cooking.

It was definitely a new take on a familiar and abundantly available vegetable. The addition of sesame seeds, coriander leaves and lemon juice makes it slightly special with a unique flavor and adds a nutritional punch. The advantage of using lentils and sesame seeds in the preparation of this pacchadi is, it gives a thick texture (as ridge gourd tends to be watery) and also a richer and fuller taste. The inclusion of fresh coriander leaves not only gave a herby flavor but also worked wonders in transforming the pale shade of ridge gourd into a vibrant green shade. Serve with white rice and you have a vegan meal. Left over pachadi works great as a spread over toasted brown bread."

Added a few curry leaves for that aromatic touch."

1. Remove husks and silk from the corn cobs. Rinse the corn and cut it into 1-2 inch pieces.

2. Rub the ginger-cilantro-chillies-salt paste on the corn pieces and set aside for 10 minutes.

3. Meanwhile, heat the oil in the body of a pressure cooker. Add the peppercorns and sliced onion and sautÃ© until the onion is lightly browned at the edges.

4. Add salt, turmeric, marinated corn pieces, coconut milk and 2 cups water.

5. Pressure cook the mixture (I needed 2-3 whistles).

6. Once the pressure comes down, mix the cornflour with a little water to make a thin paste. Boil the curry, add the cornflour paste slowly, stir well and cook for 5 more minutes.

7. Turn off the heat and stir in lemon juice. Taste and adjust for the balance of flavors, adding salt and lemon juice as needed. The recipe calls for adding a tinge of sweetness to the curry using a dash of sugar, but corn in the US is so sweet that I did not need the extra sugar."

At last I got to blog the recipe of the quintessential ‘home style’ Chicken Dum Biryani from the royal kitchen of the Nizams. A dish that calls for an elaborate process and requires lots of TLC aka ‘tender loving care’ while preparing unlike the quick pressure cooker biryani. There are two versions, Kachha (raw) and Pakki (cooked) Biryani. Today’s recipe is basically a Hyderabadi kachha style of biryani where marinated raw chicken and partially cooked basmati rice are layered and cooked on dum, over low heat. I prepared this biryani a couple of times, the recipe is perfect and has never failed me. Once the biryani is cooked on dum, as you open the lid, the kitchen smells fragrant, rich with the reassuring aroma of pure ghee and saffron and the chicken cooked to melt in the mouth tenderness."

They scour dusty bookstores and hunt down booksellers in all corners of the markets, and regularly supply me with obscure Marathi cookbooks, inexpensive ones typically printed on thin cheap paper, that often contain hidden gems in the form of little-known family recipes. The next recipe is adapted from one such tiny Marathi cookbook (a booklet, really) called â€œAjichya Vividh Koshimbiriâ€ meaning â€œGrandmaâ€™s various saladsâ€, written by Pramila Patwardhan. It is a nice compilation of different quick methods and useful ideas for serving fresh vegetables at a meal in the form of tasty salads and relishes, all prepared in simple home-style ways. Most of the salads are simply dressed with a nice balance of lemon juice, salt and a dash of sugar. Some have a savory touch with a last-minute tempering of mustard seeds and asafoetida. Coarse peanut powder is a typically Maharashtrian touch to many salads."

2 Strain the water, and grind the dal to a paste sprinkling little water and salt. Use small portions of dal to grind batch wise as its easier to grind into a soft paste. Beat till fluffy.

3 Heat water, add the jaggery and let it melt and form a syrup which is sticky to touch. While the jaggery is forming a syrup, deep fry the vadas.

4 Take a deep frying vessel, add enough oil and heat till piping hot.

5 Wet your hands with water, take a lemon-sized ball of batter and flatten it into a vada on a greased sheet or banana leaf. Make a hole in the centre of the vada so that it cooks evenly all over.

6 Slowly drop the vada into the hot oil carefully and fry it on both sides on medium heat to a golden brown color. Deep fry 4-5 vadas per batch depending on the size of the vessel.

7 Immediately dip these fried vadas into the jaggery syrup. Let them sit in this syrup till the next batch of vadas are deep-fried. Remove them onto a serving plate and drop the next batch of vadas into the syrup.

8 Drizzle some left over syrup over vadas before serving and serve hot while the crust is still crisp."

																						Wash the fish pieces with salt & turmeric (to remove the fishy smell) and allow to drain on a colander. Marinate it with 1 tsp cumin powder, 1 tsp pepper powder, 1/2 tsp turmeric powder, salt & 1 tsp lime juice. Keep aside for 15-20mins.

				
																							Finely mince each of the ingredients mentioned under 'To be finely minced'. Heat oil in a non stick pan and fry the ginger, green chillies for a couple of seconds and then add the minced onions and fry till they turn pinkish. Add the minced coriander and mint leaves and fry till you get a nice aroma (takes about 12-15 seconds). Toss in the remaining cumin & pepper powders and lime juice, stir and turn off the flame. Allow this mixture to cool.

				
																							Boil/cook the marinated fish pieces with 1/2 cup of water till the pieces are tender and almost all the water has been absorbed/evaporated - a little moisture should be retained. Let the fish not get too dry or else it will lose its juiciness and flavour. Remove onto a plate, allow to cool and mince it finely and evenly (for best results pulse it in a food processor/mixer grinder with a mincing blade).

				
																							Transfer the minced fish in a large bowl, add the fried onion mixture and mix well. Adjust salt to taste. Try to shape the mixture into balls - if they don't hold shape, then wet the bread slice lightly (with about 1tbsp water), mash it & add it to this mixture. Form a lemon sized ball and flatten it in the centre of your palm. Continue to make balls until the mixture is used up.

				
																							Heat oil in a non stick frying pan, gently dip/coat each cutlet in the egg whites and fry the cutlets on a medium flame till golden brown on both sides.

				
																							Serve hot as a meal time accompaniment or as a starter along with ketchup or dip of your choice and a garnish of tomato wedges, onion rings and lime slices."

I tried a Mediterranean inspired recipe that calls for couscous and bell peppers. Replaced couscous with dalia and I had a vibrant vegetarian meal bursting with color, flavor and textures.

Can’t put in words the surge of feelings I felt as I watched him mingle with his classmates and class teacher (I learnt she’s a sweet lady and popular among her students). I don’t know if he felt I should leave the school premises but I didn’t have the heart to leave. An easy transition from primary school and a happy moment in my life. We learned a lot this past academic year about his likes and dislikes, strengths and weaknesses and I can’t wait to see how he faces new challenges and what he accomplishes this year.

Slit each ivy gourd into two, length wise and slice them into thin long strips.

2 Heat oil in a cooking vessel. Once the oil is hot, reduce heat to medium flame, add the cumin seeds and let them splutter and turn brown. Add hing and dry red chillis and fry for a few seconds till the aroma emanates the kitchen.

3 Immediately add the sliced tindora and combine. Add salt and turmeric pwd and mix well. Saute on medium heat for 3-4 minutes, keep sauteing so that it doesnâ€™t burn. Now reduce to low flame, place lid, let it cook, approx 15-18 minutes. Keep checking in between, sauteing them so that they don’t burn. The sauteed tindora will lose moisture and begin to have a wrinkled appearance.

4 Remove lid, and cook on low-medium flame for another 20-25 mts. The tindora should retain that, slight crunchy texture. Add amchur pwd and garam masala and combine. Turn off heat.

5 Finally, adjust the salt and serve hot with steamed rice."

Its all in the texture of the pachadi which should be coarsely gound and not into a smooth paste. You should be able to bite into toasted bits of the spices and dals which gives a nice mouth-feel. Of course, not to mention the magic touch of curry leaves-mustard seeds seasoning. A delicious pachadi to go with rice."

It was an ideal snack for munching that made us take a quick peep into the Palahaara-paathram aka â€˜snack dubbasâ€™ whenever we wandered lazily through the kitchen after watching television for long or reading a book. Traditionally it is made by roasting the rice which then hand pounded and ground into a fine powder, using â€˜Ural & Ulakkaâ€™, the bigger versions of modern tabletop mortar and pestle, which is going extinct from most of the Kerala kitchens these days. The powdered roasted rice was then pounded with grated coconut and jaggery and then shaped into small balls. Though it was a physically challenging work to manually pound rice until it transforms into superfine granules, hand pounding made a world of difference. Both my maternal grandma and women at the paternal side resorted to preparing these humble snacks, on a breezy afternoon pounding rhythmically and chit-chatting with each other.

Made for a wonderful side with Chicken Dum Biryani that I prepared on Sunday. The key to this recipe, which has its origins in the hill station of Tamil Nadu, is coconut, mint and coriander leaves which lends a greenish brown shade and infuses the korma with a mild sweet herby flavor, filling the kitchen with an aroma that is almost intoxicating. The use of aniseed (saunf) and cardamom add even more fragrance and flavor to the unassuming korma. I especially love the flavor and scent of mint leaves in this recipe. Its outright delicious!"

									  How to prepare rice flour at thome - Soak 2 cups raw rice overnight. Drain the water and keep aside for 30-60 minutes. (spread it on a cloth or newspaper to dry). Grind this rice to a fine powder. Sieve the ground rice flour and use the sieved soft rice flour. Grind the left over coarse rice flour again to make a smooth powder. Use this to prepare modaks, kudumulu and appalu.

										  If its not forming a smooth, soft dough, wet your hand with milk and mix. If necessary add a few drops of milk, not more than a tablespoon.

										  If the dough become runny, add a few tablespoons of rice flour and sugar and mix.

										  Be cautious while adding ghee to the dough. Add one tablespoon of ghee initially and mix. Thereafter add 1 to 2 teaspoons and mix. Add just enough so that the dough holds shape.

										  The oil should not be too hot or else the appalu will burn quickly and not cook inside."

"Idiyappam with Egg Curry","http://www.sailusfood.com/2012/11/16/idiyappam-recipe-healthy-breakfast/","Older posts","http://www.sailusfood.com/categories/all_recipes_blogged_to_date/page/13/","The preparation process appears daunting but is pretty simple when you get down to making it. The key is to get the right consistency of the rice flour dough. A traditional Idiyappam maker is an essential tool to prepare it. I picked up an Idiyappam maker/press and plates in Wayanad. The plates are not essential if you have Idli plates. The Idiyappam maker is similar to a murukku press or janthikalu gottam. The rice flour dough is hand pressed through the maker into noodle thin swirls onto a greased plate and steamed like idlis. In Kerala, Idiyappam rice flour is easily available unlike in other states where its difficult to find. You can buy rice flour and dry roast it for 7-8 minutes on low flame and use it. I used home made rice flour and served Idiyappam with Kerala Egg Curry, the recipe of which I will post tomorrow."

																						Preheat oven to 160Â°C. Grease and line two 8"" cake pans with baking/parchment paper.

				
																							Sieve all purpose flour, baking soda and baking powder in a bowl. Add salt and whisk together. Keep aside.

				
																							In a bowl, cream butter, castor sugar and vanilla on medium-high speed until light and fluffy.

				
																							Add the eggs, one at a time, beating to combine. Add the buttermilk and beat for 10 seconds.

				
																							Add the flour, a few tbsps at a time. Use a wooden spoon to combine. Next add a little milk and stir to combine. Repeat with remaining flour and milk, ending with the flour.

				
																							Divide the cake batter equally into the two greased and lined pans. Bake for 55 mts to an hour or until a skewer inserted into the center comes out clean. (Check from 50 mts onwards) Allow to stand in pan for 10 mts.

				
																							Turn out onto a wire rack to cool down to room temperature and store in fridge. Next day, prepare the lamingtons.

				
																							Prepare the chocolate icing. Place the icing sugar, cocoa powder, butter and milk in a stainless steel bowl over a pan of simmering water.

				
																							Stir the mixture until smooth and a bit thick. It should not be a thick liquid as the cake will not absorb the chocolate coating.

				
																							Once the cake is firm on touch and not crumbly, cut into small 2 inch square pieces. Cut each square in half, sandwich with jam or chocolate sauce. Use a fork or wooden skewer and dip each sandwiched cake squares in the chocolate sauce and coat well on all sides. Place on a cooling rack and allow excess sauce to drain by placing a parchment paper below the rack.

				
																							Once the excess sauce is drained which takes about 2-3 minutes, place each chocolate coated cube on a plate of dried coconut. 

				
																							Sprinkle dried coconut all over the chocolate coated cake and allow to set for a couple of minutes and serve.

				
																							Lamingtons can be stored in an airtight container for 4-5 days."

2 After two hrs, knead the dough gently for 2 mts. Dust the working surface with some flour, pinch a large lemon sized dough and roll into a thick roti, slightly elongated in shape. Sprinkle a few onion seeds/kalonji.

3 Wet  your fingers with water and run your fingers along one side of the roti.

4 Heat a iron tawa and once its hot, place the naan, wet side down and place a lid and cook for 40-45 secs on high flame. Remove the lid and you will find that the naan bubbles up. Now cook the other side of the naan over direct heat of the burner using tongs, spreading the naan all over the heat such that brown spots appear. Do this for a few secs only and not too close to the flame.

2 Next morning, squeeze out entire liquid from each piece and spread the tomato pieces over a cloth and sun dry. Sun dry the pieces till they are completely dry with no trace of rawness.

Every evening, remove the cloth containing the tomato pieces, place indoors and next day again place back the cloth containing the tomato pieces to sun dry.

3 Pour the liquid in a very wide (shallow) vessel. Add tamarind and allow to sun dry. This could take at least 4 days of good sunshine. The liquid will thicken. Every evening, remove the tomato liquid and place indoors, place back again the next day morning to sun dry.

4 Once the tomatoes and liquid are sun-dried, combine the dried tomatoes pieces with the sun dried liquid and leave overnight, covered.

5 Next morning, blend this to a slightly coarse paste. Add red chilli pwd, methi pwd, roasted mustard pwd and combine.

6 Heat oil in a vessel. It should not be too hot. Once hot, add mustard seeds and allow to splutter.

The natural sweetness from the ripe plantains, when coated with a flour batter flavored with fragrance seeping out of the crushed cardamoms and deep fried in distinctly flavorful and aromatic coconut oil, is sure enough to take you till the doors of heaven!

In one of such shops, it is easy to find the quintessential Pazhampori, ripe plantain fritters; Sukhian, a mixture of cooked green grams sweetened with  melted jaggery dipped into a flour batter and deep fried; Bonda, mashed and spiced up potato fritters; deep fried lentil dumplings like Uzhunnu Vada and Parippu Vada; Neyyappam, a rice flour and melted jaggery batter deep fried in ghee; Unniyappam, mashed banana, rice flour, jaggery hand mixed into thick batter and poured into an aebleskiver pan and deep fried. When you travel on the northern side of Kerala, try to get a taste of Unnakkayee – mashed banana shaped into cotton pods, stuffed with sweet or savory filling and deep fried; Arikkadkukka – mussels with a mildly spiced rice paste, steamed and then deep fried. Some of the other Northern snacks that I should mention here is the Kalthappam which is a steamed cake cooked from a mixture of ground rice, jaggery and dressed up with small coconut slices and shallots. Towards the southern tip of Kerala, you may find snacks like Munthirikothu, Mothagam etc which are again the regional versions of fried fritters with lentils, coconut bits and melted jaggery."

Besides Christmas & Easter, the feast of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin Mary (BVM) or the birthday of Mother Mary is celebrated with great gusto on September 8th every year. Each of these occasions have special menus consisting of meat and vegetables, however the feast of the BVM is celebrated coinciding with the local harvest feast and hence we have a festive meal known as the ‘novein jowaan’ (new/first meal) which is made up of a pure vegetarian fare consisting of odd numbered dishes. The star of this spread is the Alun Dento (stems of the colocasia/arbi plant and tender stalks of the green amarath leafy vegetable cooked in a coconut gravy) which is eaten with Sanna. The novein jowaan is again a time of togetherness when the whole family gathers from near & far to pray and eat together. The meal is followed by a leisurely afternoon spent well in chewing sugar canes that are distributed to kids after the Mass in church."

If you are one of those who really likes a very spicy chilli then choose the spicer varieties of green chilli when preparing the majjiga mirapakaayalu.

																						Prepare the dough - In a large bowl (the one used to knead dough) add the flour, turmeric powder, salt, coconut oil and milk and mix well. Add water little by little to form a smooth soft dough. Kneading may take 7-8 minutes. Cover with a cloth and keep aside for 3-4 hours.

				
																							Prepare the filling - Cook the dal in sufficient water till it is perfectly cooked (it should retain its shape and not turn into a paste). If there is excess water - drain it off and retain the dal. Add the jaggery to it and simmer until the jaggery is melted. Toss in the powdered cardamoms. 

				
																							The mixture needs to be dryish, so continue to stir until it comes together like a ball (doesn't stick to the base of the cooker/pan). If the dal is correctly cooked you should be able to mash it with the ladle. Turn off the flame & transfer the contents onto a plate and roughly divide into 8 portions. Cover the pan so that the mixture does not dry up (else it will be hard to roll the holige)

				
																							Prepare the holige - Before you begin, knead the dough once and then pinch out 8 lime sized portions of the dough. Grease your palm well with coconut oil and taking one lime sized ball flatten it with your fingers and place the filling in the center. Pinch all the edges towards the center to seal it and carefully flatten it. 

				
																							Dust a working surface with flour and using a rolling pin gently roll the dough ball into a thin chapathi - do not to apply too much pressure or else the filling will spill out and stick to the surface. Ensure that the rolling is done evenly and the edges are smooth too. 

				
																							Fry it on a heated griddle/tawa on a medium high flame till golden brown spots appear on either side - don't fry for too long as they will turn hard. Remove and place the holige in a hot box (casserole) lined with a soft cloth - this will keep them warm and soft.

				
																							Serve warm with a dollop of ghee or butter. Holige keep well for 2-3 days in an airtight container."

One dish came to mind immediately- a coconut-based curry containing chunks of succulent corn cobs. This is corn season in the US, and the perfect time to try this curry. As one might expect, there are so many ways to make this dish; I adapted a recipe from the Marathi cookbook â€œLajawaab curriesâ€ (lajawaab can be translated as incredible or exceptional) by Sudha Maydev. It has the rather long but descriptive name of â€œMakyachya Kansanchya tukdyanchi kadhiâ€ which translated as â€œcorn cob pieces curryâ€. Pieces of corn cobs are cooked right into the curry using a pressure cooker. The savory â€œumamiâ€ flavor of corn infuses into the curry. The recipe calls for a touch of cornstarch at the end. While not particularly traditional, I liked this step because it pulled the dish together into a thick and creamy curry that enveloped the chunks of corn."

Wedding Thali: One might think the wedding thali must be very elaborate and will showcase something special for the occasion. In Khandesh, wedding invitations go out to almost everyone you know so wedding thali is kept very simple. Chapatis are made a day earlier so can be crumbled easily on the wedding day. One or two chapatis are served per person to crumble. Then make a well with these crumbles, to use as a bowl for plain daal called varan with little bit of ghee/toop. Then everything is mixed and eaten with eggplant bhaji.

2. Shev-Bhaji: Red spicy curry made with bhavnagari gathia. It is served as lunch with chapati. Onion slices and lemon are must accompaniments. Some restaurants do serve it but it is also made at home fairly regularly.

3. Vangyache Bharit (Khandesh style baingan Bharata) and Puri: Khandeshis love their eggplants in any form, so much so that even mentioning this name to Khandeshis make them want to have it right away even after full stomach. I have tried to capture photo feature of the whole process of making Khandeshi special Baingan Bharta.

4. Vafole/muthe/bhendake with kadhi: Steamed toor daal dumplings with kadhi. Buttermilk kadhi is made in earthen pot and tempered using chili-garlic-ginger paste and lichen over live fire.

5. Batti-varan: It is very similar to daal baati of Rajasthan but still very different. Battis are roasted on coal fire. It is enjoyed with simple accompaniments like Amsool Kadhi and Eggplant Bhaji.

6. Upavasachi Thali (Religious fasting thali): Sabudana Khichadi, fried sago/sabudana chakali, sabudana papad adorn the thali. But speciality of Khandesh is Raw Banana Roti with yogurt. Pancakes made with raw banana flour + Amaranth flour and some potatoes make special appearance in fasting thali."

While that statement holds true, a completely opposite statement may also equally hold true. Please note that it is impossible to generalize anything about India or any of her states. There are always going to be exceptions. Each family, each home has their own unique way of preparing food and celebrating love. As the families fervently follow the old traditions, they embrace the new ones thus creating new traditions of their own which vary from home to home.

									  Notes:

										  1. A large coconut yields approximately 2 cups thin milk & 1 cup thick milk. Here's how to do it & the substitute for it. If you do not wish to use coconut milk in your curry just use 1-1/4 cups of grated coconut instead of 1/2 cup and skip the coconut milk altogether. But you may need to adjust the spice a bit here.

										  Extracting fresh coconut milk

										  Grate the flesh of one coconut and transfer it to a mixer grinder. Add about 1/2 cup of warm water and pulse the mixer grinder for a few seconds.

										  Line a bowl with cheese/muslin cloth and transfer the ground coconut into it. Cover the cloth into a bundle and squeeze to extract thick milk. Keep aside

										  Add a little water (depending on how much thin milk you desire) and repeat process. This is the thin milk.

										  Preparing coconut milk from coconut milk powder (I use Maggi)

										  To make approx 2 cups thin milk - Dissolve 6 tbsp coconut milk powder in 1-1/2 cups warm water

										  To make approx 1 cup thick milk - Dissolve 6 tbsp coconut milk powder in 3/4th cup warm water

										  2. Mangaloreans, especially Bunts use short red chillies which are also called as Harekala chillies - these are quite spicy. The long dry chillies that are used are called the Byadge/Bedgi chillies. You may use a combination of both or just use the Bedgi variety. To reduce the spice adjust the quantity of peppercorns and use the chillies partially deseeded. For a mildly spicy curry you can use Kashmiri chillies. The original recipe asked for 22 chillies & 1 tsp peppercorns. I reduced them to 15 chillies and 1/2 tsp peppercorns which yielded a medium spicy curry. A lot of the spice gets balanced out when the coconut milk is added, so please use your judgement here.

										  3.While roasting the spices take care to ensure that they don't burn or turn black - this will lend a bitter taste to the curry which is avoidable. Ensure that roasting is done in a good quality heavy pan."

Now slowly add enough water to make a pliable dough, not too soft. Divide the dough and shape into balls. Keep aside covered with moist cloth for 15-20 mts.

2 Meanwhile, heat a vessel, add oil, add cumin seeds and allow to brown. Add the ginger, spice powders and a tbsp of water and saute for a few secs. Add the crumbled potato and boiled peas and cook over medium flame for a few minutes, approx 3-4 mts. Add kasuri methi and lemon juice, combine. Add the coriander leaves and turn off heat.

3 Now that the stuffing is ready, prepare the outer layer for the samosas.

4 Roll each ball with the rolling pin into a slightly thin puri, slightly elongated in shape as shown in the image. Take a knife and divide the rolled puri into two by cutting through the center.

5 Now take a semi-circle piece of the roti, and make a fold in the shape of a triangle as shown in the image. Seal along the fold. Now place this cone between your thumb and index finger and place a ball of the stuffing inside. Wet your finger and run it along the edges of the dough with water and seal to enclose the stuffing.

6 Press the ends firmly so that the filling does not come out during the deep frying process. Prepare with the rest of the dough in the same manner.

7 Heat enough oil in a wide vessel to deep fry the samosas. Heat the oil till hot but not piping hot. Reduce flame to low medium and drop 2-3 samosas into the oil slowly and deep fry them till golden brown, turning them carefully to the other side so that it cooks on all sides. Deep fry on low to medium heat and not piping hot oil.

The moment I utter the name of my home-state, most of the time I see their faces glowing with excitement and the next thing I hear is this, â€œ Ohâ€¦I love that red fish curry..â€ OR â€œDo you make Puttu?â€ OR â€œKerala chips are my favouriteâ€¦can you bring some next time when you go home? â€œ OR â€œthose Appam you get in Kerala is soooo softâ€. It is a pleasure to be in such proud moments to sink into the realization that Kerala cuisine is a favorite with many and it is well known too. True, these are iconic foods associated with Kerala cuisine and if you give a Google search on the same, you will come across many sites waxing eloquently about our traditional vegetable feast, Sadya  or the fiery red  fish curry or the pan-roasted fish delicacy wrapped in banana leaves called Meen Pollichathu or the aromatic Malabar Biryani  or the spicy meat preparation like Beef Fry or the lacy-fluffy Palappam served with a delightful creamy stew."

																							Heat a cast iron pan or non-stick pan. Once hot, reduce flame, sprinkle few drops of water such that they sizzle. If the water sizzles, it means the pan is right to spread out the adai batter.

				
																							Pour a ladle full of batter in the center of the pan and swirl around with back of ladle to form a concentric circle like a thick dosa/uttappam.

																						Pre-heat oven to 180 C for 15 mts. Place cupcake liners in a muffin pan and keep aside.

				
																							Sieve flour, baking powder and baking soda twice. Keep aside

				
																							In a bowl, cream the powdered sugar and butter till light and fluffy.

				
																							In another bowl, mix milk, yogurt and essence. Whisk well for a minute. Pour this milk mixture into the butter-sugar mixer and whisk till well combined.

I really wasnâ€™t in an adventurous mood and decided to play safe with the ingredients used in making a Indo-Chinese fusion meal, comprising of a vegetable stir fry and fried rice dish since we had an elderly guest visiting us for lunch. He is the typical Andhrite who loves his rice and chepa pulusu  (fish cooked in a tangy spicy sauce) and whose meal has to have spice, definitely not bland. It was a challenge for me with hubby dear wanting to eat a meal with a Chinese flavor and a relative (with an uninitiated palate to Chinese cuisine) who loves spice and was willing to eat whatever I served him. What I like about Indo-Chinese fusion cooking is, you have enough room to experiment from scratch, donâ€™t have to follow any particular cookbook method, less cooking time though the preparation time is much more than the actual cooking time and the recipes are not traditional in the sense that they havenâ€™t been passed down by our grandmothers. Indo-Chinese fusion cooking is versatile (free-style) in the fact that you can mix and match different foods and ingredients, flavors and textures to suit your palate and also gives you the freedom to concote your own recipes."

Stir to make a smooth creamy mixture on a very low flame. Turn off flame. Allow to cool for a few mts.

2 Melt chocolate in a double boiler. Alternately, heat a stainless steel vessel with about an inch of water, bring to a boil and lower the flame completely. Over the stainless steel vessel, place another vessel (the bottom of this vessel should not touch the water of the stainless steel vessel) such that is rests on the rim of the lower vessel. Place the grated chocolate in the upper vessel. The chocolate will melt due to the steam released from the hot water. Keep stirring till the chocolate melts completely.

3 Turn off the flame, remove the vessel which has the melted chocolate and keep it aside.

4 Take a square baking pan, grease and line with parchment/butter paper such that the paper is longer than the pan. (Once the fudge is set, its easy to lift out the fudge with the ends of the parchment paper). Pour the creamy peanut butter mixture and spread all over to form a thin layer. Use a flat spatula to spread it out evenly.

5 In another pan, add 1 1/2 tbsps butter and let it melt on low flame. Add the remaining condensed milk and mix. Add the melted chocolate and keep stirring for appprox 2-3 mts.. Turn off heat.

6 Over this layer, pour the chocolate mixture and allow it to spread all over the pan evenly using a spatula. Let it cool before setting it in the fridge. (I use a large bowl filled with 1 1/2 cups of cold water to place the baking pan so that it cools down before placing in the fridge to set).

7 Once it cools, cover the baking pan with a plastic wrap and set in fridge for 3-4 hours.

8 After the fudge is set, remove from fridge. Using the ends of the parchment paper, lift it out of the baking pan and place on a plate. Cut into squares and store in an air tight container. It will stay for 3-4 days."

Black Pepper was a valuable spice during ancient times and was used as a currency to trade between east and west. It’s been said that no other spice has had a greater effect on world history than pepper. The term â€˜peppercorn rentâ€™ actually came from rent which was paid in the form of pepper during the middle ages and that often a manâ€™s wealth was measured by his accumulation of pepper. So high was its value that during ancient times it was used as a currency to pay taxes and there are stories of how 3000 pounds worth of pepper was paid as ransom/tribute when the Germanic tribe or Goths laid siege to Rome, soldiers being paid in pepper for a successful campaign, dowries of pepper given and it was also used as a sacred offering. Read more about the fascinating history of black pepper and how to select, store and tips on cooking with pepper. Ancient Chinese and Sanskrit texts dating to more than 3000 years ago have mentioned about black pepper with Ayurvedic nutrition and Chinese medicine advocating the importance of black pepper as an important spice with powerful healing properties and used in treatment of ailments of stomach and throat. Its also considered to have anti-aging properties, good digestive and a detoxifier too. One of the best home remedies for cold and flu is drinking tea made of pepper corns and ginger. Aromatheraphy oil of pepper is used to clear the head, great for massaging aching muscles and for treating poor circulation."

I am back with the third and final part of the article on Mangalorean cuisine for the Indian Food trail series. Today I will take you on a culinary journey into Mangalorean Catholic cuisine in particular. As I had mentioned in the first part of the Mangalorean Food series, Mangalorean cuisine is a blend of local flavours from each community. Mangalorean Catholics have their roots in Goa and are descendants of Goan Catholics who migrated from Goa between 1560-1763 due to the Goa Inquisition,  the Portuguese – Adil Shahi wars and the Portuguese – Maratha wars (read more) and hence our culture is a blend of Goan & Mangalorean cultures. Mangalorean Catholic Cuisine is adapted from the local cuisine of South Canara but retained the Goan/Portuguese influence in a large variety of their food."

4 Prepare small lemon sized balls and place on baking sheet about 2 inches apart as they spread. Lightly flatten the balls. (If you want a chewy cookie, drop a tbsp of cookie batter on the baking sheet and do not flatten it. For a crisp cookie, make a ball and flatten it.)

5 Bake in a pre-heated oven at 180 C for about 12 mts till the edges are slightly toasted or till done. Once baked, the cookie will feel soft on touch but once cool it will harden. If you over bake beyond the mentioned time limit, you will have a very crunchy cookie.

																							Heat oil in a heavy bottomed vessel. To test if oil is hot enough for deep frying plantain slices, drop a slice into the oil, if the oil bubbles around it with a sizzling noise, the oil is ready.

				
																							Into the hot oil, drop the sliced plantain quarters (depending on the size of vessel used for deep frying, drop just enough plantain slices such that the vessel isn't overcrowded) into the hot oil. On medium flame, deep fry.

				
																							Use a slotted stainless steel ladle to stir the chips gently. When they reach golden brown color, remove them onto a paper towel to absorb any excess oil. Repeat with the remaining batch of plantain slices.

With sourness as the foremost taste, it is at the same time sweet, astringent, bitter and pungent. It is light, dry and cold in effect and the most concentrated form of Vitamin C in the entire plant kingdom and is approximately 20 times the vitamin C content of an orange. Yes, sounds amazing, isnt it? Its true. It is a very potent form of Vitamin C and yet is easily assimilated by the human body. The Vitamin C in Amla fruit is bonded with tannins that protect it from being destroyed by heat or light. Amla enhances the absorption of food, by strengthening digestion. It does this by increasing the fire (known as “Agni” in Ayurveda) in the stomach, without creating any excess stomach acids. The rich source of Vitamin C from the fruit acts as a great detoxifying agent for a sluggish liver, and helps to make the skin clear and radiant."

																						Bring a cup of water to boil. Add salt, red chilli pwd, asafoetida and rice flour and combine. Placee lid and turn of heat. Leave aside to cool.

				
																							Once cool, add cumin seeds, channa dal and butter to the rice flour mixture and combine well. Test the dough for salt before deep-frying.

				
																							Heat a wide heavy bottomed vessel with enough oil for deep frying. Take a small lemon sized ball of the dough, place on an oiled plastic sheet or banana leaf and using your fingers shape into a 2"" circle. Use a fork or knife to make small dents all over the chekkalu so that they don't puff up when deep frying.

				
																							Once the oil is hot, slowly peel the shaped chekkalu off the plastic sheet and slide into the hot oil. Based on the size of vessel and amount of oil, you can deep fry a batch of 5-8 chekkalu. Don't crowd the vessel with too many chekkalu. Reduce flame to medium and deep fry the chekkalu to a golden colour. Remember the frying has to be done on medium flame to achieve that golden color and crispness.

				
																							When the chekkalu turn a golden color use a slotted ladle to remove onto an absorbent paper and cool. Repeat the same process till the rest of the dough is done. Cool completely before storing in an air tight metallic container."

â€¢	Upkaris – These are simple vegetable dishes having a seasoning and garnished with few fresh coconut shavings. For spice, green chilli or red chilli powder is used and the vegetable is cooked in seasoning and little water. For example, beans upkari, tendli upkari(http://www.aayisrecipes.com/2006/07/04/ivygourd-sidedish-tendli-upkari/)

â€¢	Talasanis – The main difference between these and upkaris is, here the vegetable is stir fried and cooked in more oil (than using water). Usually red chilli powder is used here. Ex: Tendli talasani, batate talasani etc

â€¢	Randayis – These have a base of coconut, usually have a combination of pulses and vegetable (there are randayis with pulses alone or vegetables alone too). The coconut paste is usually watery and the dish looks mostly like gravies. But these are served on the side. The most popular in this category must be – dudde randayi, muga mole randayi. There are many such combinations that are very popular.

â€¢	Sukke, sagle – These also have a base of coconut. But unlike randayis, these have a dry(sukke) paste. Ex : navalkola sukke, vayngana sagle etc.

â€¢	Phodis  – A masala is applied to different vegetable pieces, then they are rolled in sooji and tava fried.

â€¢	Apart from these, we have kosambaris/kismuris, bharth, sasam etc."

1) Sweet Flatbreads

The most common sweet flatbread is chana daal & jaggery stuffed PuranPoLi which also appears in several different states of India. Along with PuranPoLi there are Saanjori – where shira is stuffed in the flatbread and Saatori – where khoya/mava is stuffed in the flatbread. Some other delicious sweet flatbreads are telPoLi â€“ almost similar to puranpoli but rolled paper thin and uses more oil & gulPoLi – where jaggery and poppy seeds are used to make the flatbread.



2) Yogurt based sweets

Shrikhand and Amrakhand are two most popular Maharshtrian sweets. Shrikhand is generally made in many households on the Gudhi Padva day which marks the Maharashtrian New year. When you mix mango pulp with Shrikhand you get delectable Amrakhand – a must have during the summer which also marks the mango season."

2 Heat oil in a cooking vessel. Once the oil is hot, reduce heat to medium flame, add the cumin seeds and let them splutter and turn brown. Add the red chillis, hing and curry leaves and fry for a few seconds till the aroma emanates the kitchen.

4 Immediately add the sliced dondakayalu and combine. Add salt and turmeric pwd and mix well. Saute on medium heat for 3-4 minutes, keep sauteing so that it doesnâ€™t burn. Now reduce to low flame, add the onions and let it cook, approx 15-18 minutes. Keep checking in between, sauteing them so that they don’t burn. The sauteed tendli will lose moisture and begin to have a wrinkled appearance and turns to a deeper color.

5 The dondakayalu should retain that, slight crunchy texture. Add the toasted sesame seeds at this stage and combine well and let it cook, uncovered for another a mt and turn off heat.

"Indian Food Trail ~ Mangalorean Cuisine (Part 1)","http://www.sailusfood.com/2012/08/28/indian-food-mangalore-recipes/","Older posts","http://www.sailusfood.com/categories/all_recipes_blogged_to_date/page/14/","Each of the communities mentioned above have their own style of cooking – the flavours are distinctly different yet similar in many ways. For example, many seasonal delicacies that are prepared across homes tend to use the same ingredients and cooking techniques but may slightly vary in appearance and taste. Pathrade or Pathrode is one such delicacy that is traditionally prepared during the monsoon season. Made of colocasia (arbi) leaves, rice batter & spices, Pathrade involves steaming before it is cooked in a coconut based curry or smeared with masala paste and shallow fried. Now the technique behind making the Pathrade differs between communities. While the Catholics shred the colocasia leaves and mix it with the rice batter and then steam it in leaf packets, Hindus make it by smearing the ground masala paste between a cascade of colocasia leaves and then rolling this before steaming. The roll is then cut into roundels (slices) and cooked in a gravy or fried. Similarly other seasonal delicacies such as the Turmeric Leaf Patholi (Rice dumplings with a sweet filling of jaggery & coconut steamed in Turmeric leaves), Jackfruit Patholi (Steamed Jackfrui & rice batter cakes), Jackfruit Gariyo/Garige/Mulik (Jackfruit & rice batter fritters) Kottige/Khotto (Idli batter steamed in Jackfruit leaves) are some common delicacies across sub cuisines with just a slight variation in cooking technique and flavour."

Once its boiled, slowly add the lemon juice and you will find that the milk will curdle and the whey will separate. The whey will become clear which is an indication that the milk has curdled completely. Immediately add about 10-12 ice cubes and turn off flame. Leave aside for 3-4 mts.

2 Strain the whey and add the chenna to a damp cheese cloth or a light cotton cloth. Gather the four corners of the cloth and twist it gently and rinse under cold water to remove the sourness of the lemon juice. Tie the ends and hang it at a height and allow the whey from the chenna to drain completely. Leave aside for 30 mts.

3  Remove the chenna onto a wide plate. Now knead it gently for 7 mts till there is no trace of moisture and is absolutely soft on touch. This is a very crucial step in the process of rasgulla making.

 4 While you are kneading the chenna, prepare the sugar syrup. Place a pressure cooker on the stove and add water and sugar and allow the sugar to dissolve. Bring it to a rolling boil. Add a pinch of cardamom pwd.

5 While the sugar syrup is cooking, make small smooth balls of the kneaded chenna. Ensure there are no cracks on the balls. Slowly add the chenna balls to the boiling sugar syrup. Place lid and pressure cook upto 1 whistle and continue to cook for another 4 mts.

6 Turn off heat. Once the pressure is off, remove the lid. The balls will double in size and become light and springy on touch. If you feel that the balls are not cooked yet, place lid and cook for another 5 mts without the whistle at medium heat.

7 Remove onto a serving dish, bring to room temp, refrigerate and serve chilled along with sugar syrup at room temp OR proceed to prepare rasmalai."

																						Mix all the above ingredients except oil and let the oats rava dosa batter sit for half an hour to an hour. It might thicken after a while as rava absorbs the water. 

				
																							At the time of making dosas, add more water such that it is of pouring consistency (like thick buttermilk). 

				
																							Pre-heat an iron tawa on high for a minute. Do the water test (sprinkle few drops of water over the hot tawa such that it sizzles) and reduce heat to low. 

				
																							Pour a ladle full of dosa batter from the outward base of the tawa in a circular motion. Fill the gap in the middle with dosa batter. Donâ€™t drop batter like a thick lump but pour all over, evenly, filling the gaps. 

				
																							Drizzle 1-2 tsps of oil along the edge of the dosa and the gaps in the middle.

				
																							Increase heat to medium flame and let the dosa cook for around 2 mts. At this point increase flame to high and let the dosa roast for a little less than a minute or so. If you want a slightly softer dosa, turn off heat after half a minute or so.

				
																							Serve warm with chutney of your choice."

These leaves are beneficial in the treatment of jaundice and a tablespoon of fresh red sorrel juice mixed with butter-milk (made from cow’s milk) is recommended once daily in the treatment of jaundice.



Gongura is available in abundance here and Gongura pachadi/pickle is a very popular authentic Andhra pickle variety on the lines of aavakai (raw mango pickle).These greens are used to prepare curries, stews, dals, and spicy pickles.In Andhra ,Gongura is used to prepare dishes such as Gongura Pappu (lentil),Gongura Vepudu(stir fry),Gongura royallu(prawns),gongura mamsam(mutton)and gongura pachadi,the recipe of which I am posting today.The recipe source is amma (my mother)who prepares excellent authentic andhra pickles.

Add the rice flour, combine with water by stirring it in and turn off heat immediately. Cover with lid and keep aside.

2 Once cool, add chilli pwd, sesame seeds and cumin seeds and combine with the rice dough. Knead the dough till smooth. Test the dough for salt before preparing chegodis.

3 Apply oil to your fingers and pinch a small lemon size ball of the dough and roll into a thick rope which is approx 3-4 inches in length and form a ring by pressing the ends of the rope firmly. Prepare chegodis in this manner (as shown in the image above) and place lid over them so that they don’t dry.

4 Heat a wide heavy bottomed vessel with enough oil for deep frying and once the oil is hot, place the chegodis one by one into the hot oil, you will find the oil froth up in bubbles. Let the chegodis fry on high flame till they rise to the surface.

5 Once the chegodis rise to the surface, turn heat to medium flame and cook the chegodis till they turn a golden shade. Remember the frying has to be done on medium flame to achieve that golden color and crispness. It does take a while to fry the chegodi, hence patience is required. If you reduce flame to low, the chegodis will absorb a lot of oil so remember to keep flame on medium to high.

6 When they slowly turn to a golden color, turn them over gently to the other side and cook to a golden shade. Use a slotted ladle to remove onto an absorbent paper and cool. Cool completely before storing in an air tight metallic container."

Youâ€™d think I would miss the feasts, the elaborate sweets and the lavish festival spreads. Far from it- I missed the gavarichi bhaji (simple curry of cluster beans), the pan-roasted harbare (fresh green chickpeas, available only in season), and the sugarcane juice that is sold for a couple of rupees in grubby stalls in the bustling markets. When I started my blog, I was eager to make what I thought of as blog-worthy fare attempts at fancy desserts and so on. The day that I broke down and posted a recipe for amti (the workaday staple dal of Maharashtra), my perspective on food blogging and cooking in general changed forever. I knew right away that the dishes that I seek the most, and the recipes that I treasure the most, are the ones from home kitchens, the ones that donâ€™t often make it to cookbooks or to dressed-up restaurant tables or to glossy magazine pages. When I get invited to the homes of family friends and relatives in Maharashtra, my mother gives them a call to say, please donâ€™t make any fancy, special, reserved-for-company dishes, just make your regular vegetarian home-style food (sadha jevan) because thatâ€™s what my strange daughter loves the most."

The butter will begin to melt forming a white froth on top. Now on simmer, stir occasionally and you will find that the froth will begin to thin slowly and the color of butter changing to a pale yellow shade. Continue to cook on low heat until it turns a golden color. The residue solids will settle at the bottom and the ghee which is clear, golden and translucent with a fragrant smell is ready. Filter the ghee which will solidify when completely cool. It can be stored at room temperature for 3 months or even more. Its best to prepare less quantity of ghee and finish it within a few days before preparing the next batch. That would be the best way to experience the real taste of ghee."

Rose Matta Rice maintains a pink hue as well as its flavor on cooking. Accompanying the rice is the vegetable thoran or a vegetable mezhukkuparatti, (both are colloquially called “upperi” in our houses)… sometimes both are present… a fish curry (Mulaku chaar/red spicy fish curry, or Thenga aracha meen chaar/Yellow fish curry with coconut), fish fry, yogurt, papadum and if that’s not enough maybe pickles.

~ Prepare the batter at least an hour or half an hour before you actually want to eat the dosas.

~ There is no need of fermentation for ravva dosa batter unlike masala dosa batter. Its instant.

~ The batter should not be thick but of pouring consistency like a thick buttermilk consistency.

~ Letting the batter sit in the refrigerator for a few hours also helps in attaining crisp dosas not that you cannot prepare crisp dosas with batter sitting for just an hour. Infact the dosas you see in this post were prepared from dosa batter that was mixed just an hour before preparation.

~ Infact the most important factor in the making of ravva dosa is adjusting the heat control. An iron tawa requires higher heat as compared to non-stick pan. I have used an iron tawa and so adjust heat according to the pan you use to prepare dosas. You need to be around the stove while preparing these dosas.

~ There are many variations in preparing rava dosa. You could add grated carrot and coconut to the batter along with rest of ingredients. Or add some sliced onions while the dosa is cooking. Broken cashewnut pieces can also be added to the dosa batter.

~ At the time of preparing rava dosa, use the ladle to stir the dosa batter well, as the flours tend to sink to the bottom of the vessel like a thick residue. So combine well each time you pour the dosa batter over the tawa.

~ You can flip the dosa and cook the other side as well but I don’t usually flip the dosa. I let it cook on one side only.

~ A cast-iron tawa is best or a non-stick pan (used exclusively for dosas) can be used to prepare rawa dosas.

~ Don’t skimp on the oil to save a few calories, as it helps the rawa dossa get crisp. (don’t ever think of calories when you want to relish rava dosa):)

~ The batter can be stored in the refrigerator for 2-3 days after which it will turn sour (i.e the dosas prepared from batter more than 3-4 days old)."

Ginger can reduce excess Kapha and restore agni, making it the best medicine for colds and flus.Herbs that can restore balance to Kapha are especially ginger(allam,adrak) and holy basil (tulasi),cinnamon(dalchini),licorice(athimadhuramu,jethimadh), black pepper and cloves(lavanga).

I learnt this recipe during my college days from one of my numerous North Indian friends who would bring it in her tiffin dabba with rotis. I reminse the days when we would swap our tiffin dabbas and how I’d lap up delicious North Indian fare like stuffed paranthas and chole while my friends would relish our South Indian tiffins like masala dosas, idlis and garellu. I always tried out different combinations of a particular dish(which is new to me) using different spices with recipes like curried baby potatoes and aloo palak and finally settle for one which is suited to my palate in terms of spice and flavor. North Indian cuisine calls for the use of less spice than our Andhra cuisine. If I feel that the flavor of a dish needs to be pepped up a bit in terms of spice then I do make a subtle change without playing too much with the ingredients and cooking style of the authentic original recipe. The end result has never been disappointing so far and I always had my family and friends relish the food served to them..:)"

"Indian Food Trail – Maharastra (Guest Post by Nupur)","http://www.sailusfood.com/2008/09/01/indian-food-trail-maharastra-guest-post-by-nupur/","Older posts","http://www.sailusfood.com/categories/all_recipes_blogged_to_date/page/32/","When I think of everyday lunches in Maharastra, I picture a wide stainless steel thali (plate) dotted with endless delicious morsels. I have to say that my perspective is from a particular community in Maharashtra and an urban middle-class family; there are so many regional cuisines within the state itself and rural cuisine merits a different discussion altogether. Being neither in the rice-loving South of India nor in the wheat-eating North, most Maharastrian families embrace both these staples and serve both steamed rice and bread, generally large chapattis or what is called ghadichi poli (layered rotis). The rice is most often served with dal/split lentils in the form of varan (plain toor dal) or amti (seasoned toor dal). Families seem to have their own traditions about the order in which rice and rotis are served. In our family, it was always rotis first. The other components of lunch are- a sukki bhaji (dry vegetable), rassa bhaji (vegetable curry), paaley bhaji (green leafy vegetable), usal (sprouts) and koshimbir (raw vegetables). But wait- thereâ€™s more! Usually, there will be a fresh chutney, dry chutney powder, pickles, a small mound of salt, wedges of lemon and a cup of yogurt to use up every last square inch on the plate. I truly marvel at the wholesomeness of such a meal, which is brimming with the goodness of fresh seasonal produce, both raw and cooked, and complete with nutritional powerhouses like leafy greens and sprouts. The other thing I marvel about is just how elaborate this meal is. What a commitment it must be for the home cook to put such a lunch on the table day after day. Grandmothers and grandaunts tell me about a time when large joint families had several competent women in the kitchen where these meals could be accomplished using teamwork. They also sigh and say that one started making lunch right after clearing away the breakfast dishes and then started dinner prep right after lunch. The whole day revolved around making sure the family was properly fed. Today, such meals are hardly commonplace for nuclear families. But I do use this meal as an inspiration and remind myself to include these classic dishes of greens and sprouts regularly in our diet."

â€¢	Heat a Kadai/Cheenachatti or a stainless steel pan, and roast the rice, in medium heat, until the rice starts splitting and changes its colour. Reduce the heat to low if required and keep stirring, especially when you hear the splitting sound and continue to roast until the full batch of rice is uniform in colour and shrink a bit from its original size. Remove this to a grinder/mixer/blender

â€¢	In the same pan, heat ghee and roast cashew nuts until they reach golden brown and keep this aside.

â€¢	Grind the roasted rice into a fine powder and transfer it to a bowl.

â€¢	In the same grinder bowl, add cashew nuts and powder it. To this add freshly grated coconut and jaggery and grind for less than a minute or till everything is blended together. Now add the crushed cardamom seeds, finely ground roasted rice powder and leftover ghee, if any, after roasting cashew nuts and whirl everything together until it is thoroughly combined. Transfer the entire mixture to a bowl. Take a fistful of the mixture and shape into a small ball, making the surface as smooth as you can. This yields around 10-11 Ariyunda and you can store it in an airtight container for up to a week and do refrigerate if you want to store it for more than that. Note: You may notice some white specks on my Ariyunda and that is because I added some more grated coconut towards the end and did not get blended well.

																						Dry roast the black pepper corns, sesame seeds and curry leaves in a pan for a few minutes on medium heat tossing them around till the flavors come out and you find a nice aroma emanates the kitchen. Once the seasame seeds change color you can turn off the heat and make a coarse powder.

				
																							Heat ghee in a pan and add the mustard seeds and let them pop. Add the cumin seeds and let them brown. Add the cooked rice and combine it with the tempering. Now add the ground spice pwd and salt and combine the rice with it such that the spices coat the rice well. The full flavor of the pepper is obtained on freshly ground pepper corns which enhances the taste of the rice giving it a sharper, more lively flavor than the pre-ground pepper powder and also by adding it towards the end of the cooking process which further enhances its taste. Serve hot with any gravy curry or plain rasam, appadam (papad) and curds."

Wash and pat dry the green chillis and make vertical slits half way along the green chilli on two sides. The slits have to be made such that the green chilli is intact and doesn’t open up. Generally the seeds of this particular variety aren’t too many so I don’t really remove the seeds, as when you make the slits a few seeds do pop out on their own. You can remove a few seeds but ensure you dont break the green chilli. Now soak them in enough quantity of thick buttermilk (one kilo of green chillis will require 2 tbsps of salt) with salt added to it till they are well immersed for 3 days (and nights).

Once hot, slide a tortilla into the oil and immediately place the bottom of the taco mould on the center of the tortilla and press gently into the oil and hold for 12-15 secs.

									  Dry roast the oats on low to medium flame for 5-6 minutes, cool and grind to a fine powder.

										  Prepare the batter at least an hour or half an hour before you want to eat the dosa.

										  The batter should not be thick but of pouring consistency like a thick buttermilk consistency.

										  If you do not have buttermilk on hand, use only water. Sour buttermilk gives a nice flavor to the dosa.

										  An iron tava works best for this type of dosa.

										  You can add grated coconut or carrot and broken cashewnut for variation."

Many a times we use the ingredients which are grown in our backyard or which can be picked from any farmerâ€™s market. The belief of â€œSimple living and high thinkingâ€ is highlighted not only in our culture but also in everyday food we cook at home. Mangalore has tropical climate and thus has abundant palm/coconut trees all around. Every smallest of small back gardens in my native has at least one coconut tree and curry plant and thus its no wonder that these two are the heart and soul of Udupi-Mangalorean cuisine. So it doesnâ€™t come as a surprise that everyday food cooked and served has two main ingredients-coconuts and curry leaves with a touch of love of course."

Every vegetable adds a unique flavor to the resulting pohe. I think the most outrageously different pohe would be the one paired with shrimp or prawns (fresh or dry). It is considered a specialty of a certain community in Maharashtra. And I have had a privilege of tasting them at a friend’s place. However the most important pohe is definitely kande pohe. They are synonymous with the wedding arrangements at the bride’s house. “Kaande Pohe program kadhi?” is a loaded question, though it just appears as simple as â€œwhen are you going to have Kande pohe?â€. What it really means is if the groom’s family has come over “to see” the bride yet or not?:-D I think, it has the same association with pre-wedding rituals like â€œSoji & Bajjiâ€ in other parts of â€“ probably South â€“ India."

However, modern lifestyle and lack of free time to make these goodies at home has resulted in a lot of people purchasing the eatables from bakeries. In the olden days Kuswar was prepared at home in bulk by the ladies and stored in large aluminium dabbas and distributed amongst close family & neighbours. This tradition was lovingly followed by my paternal grandmother and my mother and the Kuswar was distributed among the neighbouring families.

Yes, its fiery and if your one who just can’t take spice, cut down on the size of ginger piece and chillis but do add either a dried red or green chilli. It sure gives a distinctive taste to the pachadi. Makes a great pachadi with idlis and dosas but also goes well with hot rice and a dollop of ghee. Just remember to reduce the quantity of water while grinding to make it more like a thick coarse paste if preparing to eat with rice. Be sure to use clear, smooth tender ginger root and not the mature or shrivelled looking one. When you slice the ginger, your knife should cut through smoothly without much effort."

Every region of India be it North or South, East or West, has its own range of traditional savories which can be nibbled on any time of the day and make great accompaniments with coffee, tea or beverages/juices/cocktails. Preparing traditional savories at home has drastically reduced over the past few years with most of them being available at home foods outlets in almost every city. I reminse my childhood days of the wonderful aromas emanating from ammammaâ€™s and ammaâ€™s kitchens cooking savories like pakodas (fritters), jantikalu, muruku or chakli etc almost every other day and stored in big dabbas and how we would go scrambling into the pantry, immediately on coming back from school, with pangs of hunger, to devour them."

1/2 kg white or red boiled rice (ukda chawal) * see notes

1-1/2 cups grated coconut

salt to taste

Method:

1. Wash and soak the rice for at least 3-4 hours (for best results). Drain and keep aside. If you are using a traditional grinding stone, grind the rice and salt to a slightly coarse, thick & dryish paste. Add the coconut towards the very end (the coconut should not be fully ground). If you are using a mixer grinder you may need to add some water (sparingly) to grind the rice & coconut – the batter may be slightly thinner in this case.

2. If you have a bit of a thin batter, transfer it into a non stick pan and cook on a medium low flame stirring until all the excess moisture evaporates and you have a lump. You know it’s ready when the base begins to brown slightly. Turn off the flame and transfer onto a large bowl. When it is cool enough to handle, quickly knead to achieve a smooth surface.

3. Grease your palm with oil if required and pinch out lemon sized balls of the dough. Roll to form a smooth surface and form a dimple with your thumb. Continue until all the dough is used to make mutlims.

4. Transfer all mutlims into a bowl, cover with a cloth and steam for 20-25 minutes. The mutlims are done when their surface is no longer sticky.

5. Serve hot with chicken or mutton curry of your choice."

Knead the dough till smooth and firm. Test the dough for salt before preparing the biscuits.

2 Pinch a large lemon size ball of the dough and roll into slightly thick roti. Use a fork to prick the roti all over. Using a sharp knife, cut the roti length wise about an inch apart. Then cut into 2 inch squares.

3 Heat a wide heavy bottomed vessel with enough oil for deep frying and once the oil is hot, place the cut maida squares one by one into the hot oil, you will find the oil froth up in bubbles. Let the squares/chips fry on high flame till they rise to the surface.

4 Once the chips rise to the surface, turn heat to medium flame and cook the squares till they turn a golden shade. Turn them over gently during the cooking process so that they cook on all sides. Remember the frying has to be done on medium flame to achieve that golden color and crispness. If you reduce flame to low, the chips will absorb a lot of oil, so keep flame on medium to high while frying.

5 Use a slotted ladle to remove onto an absorbent paper and cool. Cool completely before storing in an air tight metallic container."

It is one of the most ancient and “sattvic” foods known, healing to all doshas: best for Vatas, soothing for Pittas, and balancing for Kaphas in moderation. Please read my first article on Ayurveda to learn about the three doshas. For cold, dry, stiff and airy Vata types, ghee adds heaviness and lubrication to the body in the joints and in the digestion. Ghee is cooling and soothing for the fire-based ailments of Pittas, such as fever, acidity, and inflammation. For all three doshas, ghee helps memory and is a healthy fat that is good for the liver and immune system, though Kaphas should consume it in moderation as it also helps build body mass."

2 In a separate bowl, sieve maida, baking soda and baking pwd from a height

3 Add a tbsp of flour and mix, alternating with a tbsp of milk. Repeat the process till the flour is completely incorporated with the wet ingredients. If the batter is too thick, you can add more milk.

4 Take 3 small bowls. Pour 2 heaped tablespoons of plain batter into each of the 3 bowls. I used 3 colors. Add few drops of each of the edible colors in each bowl. Mix well.

5 Preheat the oven to 200 C. Grease the baking pan. The most important part is assembling the cake batter in a baking pan.

6 Pour 1/2 tbsp of plain white batter in center of the baking pan. Allow it to spread a little. Pour a tsp of one of the colored batter (chocolate color) on top of it and allow to spread a little. Again pour a little less than 1/2 tbsp of plain batter on top of it. Next add a tsp of another colored batter (pink color) on top of it and pour less than 1/2 tbsp of plain batter on it. Next add a tsp of another colored batter (yellow color) and on top of it add less than 1/2 tbsp of plain batter. Keep repeating this process till the batter is complete.

7 Remember to pause for a while for each of the colors to spread before adding the next layer. There is another optional step where you can run a toothpick on top to create a floral effect as shown in the picture above.

8 Bake for 10 minutes at 200 C and reduce temp to 175 C and bake for another 40-45 mts. Insert a toothpick into the center of the cake and it should come out clean. Remove from the oven. Leave aside for 30 mts and invert the cake onto a cooling rack. Turn the cake back over and cool further."

Free radicals are unstable, reactive molecules with a free electron that seek to latch onto whatever they can find and are generated by the metabolism of oxygen and other chemicals.Unsaturated fats, certain reactive chemicals, both inhaled and consumed in food or water, microbes,polluted environment and smoking cigarettes all generate free radicals. When these free radicals are not countered by antioxidant nutrients, they may attack healthy cells,cell membranes, fat molecules, or tissue linings in our body and weaken them and if left unchecked, they may contribute to heart damage, cancer, cataracts and other illnesses and may also weaken our immune system.So you want to fill your body with an abundance of antioxidants, while you do your best to avoid oxidant poisons.Antioxidants, also termed as “free-radical scavengers,” protect us by binding the free radicals and when we get sufficient levels of these antioxidants, such as vitamin E and Vitamin C, selenium, and beta-carotene in our diet, we can neutralize the free radicals and prevent cellular and tissue damage. For an better overview and understanding of free radicals and antioxidants follow this link."

Yes, besides eating rice in its virgin form (piping hot steamed rice), we transform it into several breads made of rice batter that is most often steamed in a steamer or thondor as we call it in Konkani or fried on cast iron griddles. We use different varieties of rice for meals and in the preparation of rice breads. Mangalorean recipes like Rice cakes (Idlis & Sanna), Pancakes (Neer Dosa, Dosa, Appams, Rotti/Bhakri), Stringhoppers (Sevai/Sheviyo/Shavige) are all popular breads that are part of all sub-cuisines and are eaten for breakfast, along with curries (vegetarian or non vegetarian) during mealtimes and are often sweetened with jagggery & coconut and served as an evening tea time snack. Neer Dosa with a sweet filling (called as Portha Polay in Konkani) is one of my all time favourites."

																						Put together rice flour, gram flour, salt, hot ghee, chilli pwd, ajwain and sesame seeds, and combine them well. Slowly add water little by little to make a soft dough, just soft enough that it is pressed through easily with the janthikalu press. Test the dough for salt and chilli pwd before deep-frying.

				
																							Heat a wide heavy bottomed vessel with enough oil for deep frying. Take the janthikalu gottam aka murukku press and use the disc with small holes. Fill half of the press with the dough and once the oil is hot, reduce to medium flame and using circular motion, press the jantikalu gottam to make concentric layers of the janthikalu dough. As you press the dough into the hot oil, you will find the oil froth up in bubbles which will eventually subside as the janthikalu turn to a golden shade. Remember the frying has to be done on medium flame to achieve that golden color and crispness.

				
																							When the janthikalu turn a golden color, turn over to the other side and let it also cook to a golden brown. Use a slotted ladle to remove onto an absorbent paper and cool. Repeat the same process till the rest of the dough is done. Cool completely before storing in an air tight metallic container."

This is loved by both kids and adults alike as it contains raw vegetables and fruit along with roasted peanuts. My personal favourite spots which sell the best Churu-muri are located at Panamboor and Malpe beach, Kadri Park and the one located neat St. Aloysius college in Mangalore. And fortunately my husband Krish is quite famous among our friends and family for whipping up this delicious street food. So this recipe comes from Krish which we make it a point to have at least once in every fortnight. Add as much or as little as chilli powder depending on how spicy you want it to be and adjust the quantity of vegetables used according to your taste. It tastes best when coconut oil is used but feel free to use vegetable oil in its place. But try to avoid using strong flavoured oil in this recipe. Also, remember to serve it immediately as soon as the puffed rice is mixed with spicy vegetables to enjoy this puffy, crisp and spicy goodness."

																							Remove the vadas onto a bowl of water or thin buttermilk. Allow them to soak for 3 minutes. 

				
																							While the vadas are soaking, prepare the yogurt/curd mixture. Heat 2 tsps oil in a vessel, add mustard seeds and allow to splutter.

1. Boiled rice is different from cooked rice. Boiled rice is a variety of rice that is involves partial boiling of paddy before it is de-husked and sold. Boiled rice with bran is called as brown/red boiled rice and that without the bran is called as white boiled rice available at most grocers by the name Ukda Chawal (in Hindi) or Katsambar (in Kannada) or Ukdo Tandul (in Konkani)

2. You can make the sweeter version of these dumplings by stuffing a jaggery & coconut mixture into the dough just before steaming. These are known as god mutlim.



In the olden days when families were large and affordability was low, fresh fish was replaced by dried fish/shrimp. A typical meal in a Mangalorean Catholic family of moderate means would be Pez ani Galmbyachi Chetni or Karyachi Chetni (rice congee served with a chutney made of shrimp or dried fish). Dried fish was often cooked along with vegetables that have longer shelf life than others such as Mogem (Field Marrow/Madras Cucumber) or Kualo (Ash Gourd/White Pumpkin/Winter Melon)."

Our doshas inform us of our specific balance of elements, and therefore what our tendency might be. The three main doshas are Vata (predominantly air and space elements), Pitta (predominantly fire and water elements) and Kapha (predominantly earth and water elements). A person can be one of these, or a combination — I myself am Pitta-Kapha, so the predominant elements in my system are fire and water plus earth. This means I generally need to balance myself by eating foods with air (Vata) qualities, such as dried fruits, mild spices, puffed grains, dry and astringent foods. Eating too much food with Pitta or Kapha qualities (spicy, deep-fried, stewy, juicy or oily) will aggravate” my dosha."

The authentic version of Shahi Tukda, calls for use of full fat milk and deep frying the bread in ghee (clarified butter) till a deep golden brown shade is achieved. I did not deep fry the bread slices (hence lighter colored bread) and chose to toast it on a pan drizzled with a generous amount of ghee. I have used low fat milk and hence you will not find a rabri (thickened milk) like consistency. It tastes as good as the deep fried version, due to the cardamom and saffron infused thickened milk that is poured over the toasted bread and garnished with toasted dried fruit and nuts. So are you going to make Shahi Tukda this Diwali?"

It was only as a young teenager that I began to start liking it ever since I tasted a bittergourd stir fry with toasted cashewnuts at a cousin’s wedding. I would never have tasted it had I known it was bittergourd. It didn’t look like bittergourd that I disliked but with pleasing looks, an appetite-pleasing vegetable stir fry, cashewnuts and all. When told it was kakarakaya vepudu, with disbelief writ on my face, I asked for a second helping. My love for this knobbly, bitter-tasting vegetable grew leaps and bounds since then."

Since there is so much to talk about the food I have grown up eating, loving and cherishing, I donâ€™t think I will be able to do full justice to it in one post. So I have decided to concentrate on just one part of food which is loved by not just the people from my native but also cherished by many people from around the globe. For more than four decades Mangalore has been a hub of many prestigious educational institutions and it has attracted thousands of students from every corner of India and around the world. One thing that is loved by everyone is the Street Food. As much as we love Chaats, pizzas, burgers and varieties of other fast foods, our love for authentic Mangalorean street food has never diminished in this fast changing world. The main reason for their popularity is their taste and the ingredients used in making them. Most of these street foods use coconut and curry leaves in one way or the other and they simply add depth of flavour and aroma to any dish they touch."

These leaves and flowers have a cooling effect and act as an appetizer."

Slowly add water little by little to make a soft dough, just soft enough that it is pressed through easily with the janthikalu/chakali press. Test the dough for salt before deep-frying.

2 Heat a wide heavy bottomed vessel with enough oil for deep frying. Take the janthikalu gottam aka murukku press and use the disc with smallest holes. Fill half of the press with the dough and once the oil is hot, reduce to medium flame and using circular motion, press the jantikalu gottam to make concentric layers of the sev dough. As you press the dough into the hot oil, you will find the oil froths up in bubbles which will eventually subside as the sev turns to a golden shade. Remember the frying has to be done on medium flame to achieve that golden color and crispness.

3 When the sev turns a golden color, turn over to the other side and let it also cook to a golden brown. Use a slotted ladle to remove onto an absorbent paper and cool. Repeat the same process till the rest of the dough is done. Cool completely before storing in an air tight metallic container."

I will not go into the scientific proof of these aphrodisiac foods but right now in todayâ€™s fast paced world, the best aphrodisiac is to keep the mobiles and PCâ€™s turned off, plan a delectable rendezvous, create intimacy with some candles and soft music,j st be there for each other and get captivated by the fragrance of love.

									  You can sprinkle grated cheese over the omelette as soon as you remove it from the pan. The heat of the omelette, lightly melts the cheese.

										  You can add other vegetables or mushroom or shredded chicken.

										  Whisk the egg mixture well, just before pouring it over the hot pan and do not cook on high flame.

										  Pour the egg mixture only after the pan has heated well. It means, if you add a drop of water, it should sizzle."

Using quarter of the dough, divide into 4 equal pieces. Shape 2 of these pieces into a ball, pulling edges under to make a smooth top. Place buns smooth side up on the greased sheet at least 2-3 inches apart. I prepared foot long hot dog buns with the remaining two pieces. Roll the dough into an oblong shape. Let rise in warm place until double in size for 30 mts. Bake in a pre-heated oven at 400 F for 15-17 mts or until golden. Remove from sheet and cool on a wire rack. I sprinkled sesame seeds on one foot long and one round bun. You can top buns with sesame or poppy seeds or whatever your desire.



Twist rolls: Take half of quartered portion of the dough and roll into a 12 inch rope, fold in half and twist. Seal the ends. Place on greased cookie sheets and proof until doubled in size for about 30 minutes. Brush each roll with milk. You can sprinkle rolls with sesame or poppy seeds.
